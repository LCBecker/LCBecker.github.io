  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/dvorak.jpg" title="Dvorak keyboard" alt="Dvorak keyboard"></p>

<p>My latest project has been utilizing my art degree (wait, what? An art degree is useful as a software engineer? Surprisingly, YES). Using Inkscape, I created a very customized keyboard as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). There were two things I had to do with this file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Embed the SVG into a view inside my AngularJS application.</li>
<li>Each key element/node needed an <code>ng-click</code> attribute so when it was pressed, something would happen. Because, you know, what good is a key if you can&rsquo;t click on it?</li>
</ol>


<p>As I discovered, these two tasks are a lot harder than they should be. Putting an SVG into a view is as simple as making the file path the <code>data</code> of an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> in the HTML. You can add an <code>ng-click</code> to the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, but that only works if you want the entire SVG to be clickable. I wanted interactivity <em>inside</em> the SVG itself. Adding <code>ng-click</code> as an attribute within a node in the SVG file will NOT work! To do what I wanted, I neede to use directives to embed the SVG in the view and attach a <code>ng-click</code> attribute to each of my keys.</p>

<p>I found <a href="" title="https://goo.gl/3s3Vlu">this site</a> that had an interactive map and thought, &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s kind of similar to what I want to do!&rdquo; So, using their insights, I was able to make a clickable keyboard within my AngularJS application. Here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>

<h3>Add A Class and Unique ID to SVG Nodes</h3>

<p>My keys were mainly circle elements with some text on top. I flattened my SVG to one layer to ensure that when a user clicked anywhere inside the circle element, it would trigger a click event. I added a class to each circle element and also updated the id of each circle element to reference its value, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;circle
    r="43"
    cy="569"
    cx="227"
    style="fill:#4d4d4d;stroke:#000000;stroke-width:3"
    id="btn_MENU"
    class="boardKeys" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Make Two Directives</h3>

<p>I just put both directives in the same file: keyDirectives.js.</p>

<p>Directive One: Embed the SVG.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var myApp = angular.module('KeyboardAppModule');

myApp.directive('svgKeys', ['$compile', function($compile) {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        templateUrl: 'images/keyboard.svg',
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
            var keys = element[0].querySelectorAll('.boardKeys');
            angular.forEach(keys, function(path, key) {
            var myKey = angular.element(path);
            myKey.attr("myKey", "");
            $compile(myKey)(scope);
            })
        }
    }
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice these details: <code>var keys</code> is an array of all elements with the class <code>boardKeys</code>&hellip;the same class I attached to each circle element (key) inside my SVG. For each of these circles, the directive adds the attribute <code>myKey</code> which is really the name of Directive Two. Directive Two is then initiated. But first, since I now have the directive that places the SVG into the view, take a look at the view&rsquo;s HTML:</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
        <div svgKeys></div>
    </div>
</div>


<pre><code>
See how I just threw that directive in there? That'll just embed the SVG in that div! Woohoo! But wait, I still need to register clicking a key.

Directive Two: Add `ng-click` to all keys.
</code></pre>

<p>myApp.directive(&lsquo;myKey&rsquo;, [&lsquo;$compile&rsquo;, function($compile) {
    return {
        restrict: &lsquo;A&rsquo;,
        scope: true,
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
            scope.elementId = element.attr(&ldquo;id&rdquo;);
            scope.keyClick = function() {
                scope.pressKey(scope.elementId);
            };
            element.attr(&ldquo;ng-click&rdquo;, &ldquo;keyClick()&rdquo;);
            element.removeAttr(&ldquo;myKey&rdquo;);
            $compile(element)(scope);
        }
    }
}]);</p>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>So, Directive One added the <code>myKey</code> directive to each key, which then calls Directive Two, which adds the <code>ng-click</code> attribute to each key. For me, I used a function called <code>pressKey()</code> in my controller. It&rsquo;s accessible via scope and I felt that my controller is where someone would look to see what happens when a button is clicked. You could just as well define what should happen when a key is clicked here in the directive. Also notice that I pass <code>scope.elementId</code> to my <code>pressKey</code> function. <code>scope.elementId</code> is the key&rsquo;s ID! So, now I know <em>which</em> key was clicked and can handle the case as needed!</p>

<h3>FIN</h3>

<p>It obviously doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of code to make an SVG file&rsquo;s elements interactive in Angular, but it&rsquo;s certainly not intuitive. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s great that this code works and I&rsquo;m excited for my next Angular application with interactive SVGs!</p>

<h6>IO Graph Art by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanmac87/4415951740">nathanmac87</a></h6>

<p><strong>Post revised 11/23/2015 for correctness. Thank you to Jan-Olav Eide and Tim Bart for leading me in the right direction!</strong></p>

<p>My most recent project at work has been to utilize DropWizard metrics to gather information about an application I built and send that data to Graphite to display in a realtime dashboard. As I normally do, I reviewed the documentation for <a href="https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/getting-started/">Dropwizard Metrics</a>, but as usual, there was a lot to be desired. Their example did not go into the nitty gritty of <em>how</em> to connect everything together. The internet was also silent on how to actually use DropWizard metrics.</p>

<p>So here is my tutorial on how <em>I</em> was able to get DropWizard metrics up and running in my application:</p>

<h3>1. Maven Application? Update pom.xml</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a Maven application, you&rsquo;ll need to add metrics-core as a dependency. If you&rsquo;re using some sort of special reporter like Graphite, you may need to add additional dependencies. This was what I had to add to my pom:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.dropwizard.metrics&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metrics-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.dropwizard.metrics&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metrics-graphite&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.dropwizard&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;dropwizard-metrics-graphite&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.9.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Start Your Metrics On Application Startup</h3>

<p>Supposedly, there are two ways you can initialize your metrics reporters. A reporter sends your data to either the console, logger, Graphite, or other DropWizard-approved outputs. You can either specify them in your config.yml file, as seen <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29432586/dropwizard-yaml-for-graphite-server-configuration">here</a>. This is supposed to start reporting your metrics automatically when you start your application. I tried this method, but I had zero luck with it. I ended up getting some parsing error from within DropWizard&rsquo;s validation library.</p>

<p>So, I initialized my metrics an alternative way&ndash; in the <code>run()</code> method of my application class. DropWizard&rsquo;s environment already creates a <code>MetricRegistry</code> object on startup. This object manages all of our metrics (these are timers, counters, meters, histograms, and gauges). Since I added metrics to my resources class, I needed to pass that <code>MetricRegistry</code> object to my resource class. This is how my application class looked:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyApplication extends Application&lt;MyConfiguration&gt;{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new MyApplication().run(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(MyConfiguration config, Environment env) throws Exception {

        final Graphite graphite = new Graphite(new InetSocketAddress("my.graphite.host", 2003));

        final GraphiteReporter reporter = GraphiteReporter.forRegistry(env.metrics())
            .prefixedWith("upToYou")
            .convertRatesTo(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .convertDurationsTo(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
            .filter(MetricFilter.ALL)
            .build(graphite);
        reporter.start(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        environment.jersey().register(new MyResource(env.metrics()));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some things to note: The <code>prefixedWith</code> is not required. What this does is append a label in front of our metrics names. I&rsquo;ll explain this more in Step 3.</p>

<h3>3. Add Metrics To Your Resources</h3>

<p>I wanted metrics like &lsquo;How many requests are we getting at /path1&rsquo; and &lsquo;How long is it taking for the method handling /path1 to return a response&rsquo;. Chances are you are, too. In order to do this, we&rsquo;ll need to add metrics to our resources. And those metrics need to be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; in the <code>MetricRegistry</code> from Step 2. So we&rsquo;ll need to create a constructor for our resource that will take in the <code>MetricRegistry</code> object we passed in Step 2.</p>

<p>There are two ways to add metrics to your resources: using annotations and by actually creating objects of a metrics class. I&rsquo;ll give you an example of both:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyResource {
     MetricRegistry metrics;
     Meter requestCount;

     public MyResource(MetricRegistry registry) {
        this.metrics = registry;
        requestCount = metrics.meter(MetricRegister.name("requestCount"));
     }

     @POST
     @Path("/path1")
     @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
     @Timed(absolute=true, name="requestRuntime")
     public Response handleRequest() {
        requestCount.mark();
        return Response.ok("Hello World").build(); //you know what I mean...
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice these details:</p>

<ul>
<li>We declare the meter <code>requestCount</code>, which will give us the total count of all calls made to /path1 and how many requests /path1 gets in 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15 minute timeframes. We initialized this <code>Meter</code> object in our Resource constructor, It&rsquo;s initialization uses our <code>MetricRegistry</code> so it can manage it accordingly.</li>
<li>See the <code>@Timed</code> annotation? DropWizard will automatically create a timer and whenever <code>handleRequest()</code> is called, the timer will record how long it takes to complete this method. We do not need to initialize a timer object ourselves. We can name this timer. I&rsquo;ve added the <code>absolute=true</code> field, because otherwise, the entire path of this metric in Graphite will be my prefix + package path + class + requestRuntime. Too long! By setting absolute to true, the metric path is just the prefix + the metric name.</li>
<li>Remember in Step 2 when we saw that <code>.prefixedWith("upToYou")</code>? Basically, our reporter, whether Graphite or the console or something else, will refer to this metric by the prefix + name of the metric. Graphite showed me options to graph like, &ldquo;upToYou.requestCount.count&rdquo; and &ldquo;upToYou.requestCount.mean&rdquo; (the &lsquo;count&rsquo; and &lsquo;mean&rsquo; part are automatically attached by DropWizard metrics). You don&rsquo;t need any prefix, but if you want it, go for it back in Step 2.</li>
<li>Finally, we call our meter&rsquo;s <code>mark()</code> method. That tells the metric, &ldquo;Hey, the method we&rsquo;re tracking has been called! Increment the meter count!&rdquo; The <code>mark()</code> method is for the meter metric, though. Please refer to the <a href="https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/getting-started/">DropWizard Metrics</a> documentation on how to initialize and call counters, histograms, and other metrics. Now, here we&rsquo;ve programmatically called the meter&rsquo;s method. We don&rsquo;t have to do that. We could just use the annotation <code>@Metered(absolute=true, name="myMeter")</code> and DropWizard would automatically call <code>mark()</code> for us whenever our method was called. But this is how you would do it if you wanted additional control&hellip;or multiple meters on a single method.</li>
</ul>


<h3>4. Profit</h3>

<p>Now, when we start up our application, our metrics will be monitoring what we want and sending data to the console or Graphite or wherever!</p>

<p>So, there you have it! This is how everything ties together in DropWizard Metrics! And I&rsquo;m the first person to actually write an example of this! Woohoo! I hope you have enjoyed this post and that it&rsquo;s given you a decent amount of confidence to use DropWizard metrics in your application! Happy Coding!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am so excited about this post! It&rsquo;s a technical post! With code! I wanted to write this to help others who might find themselves in the same predicament.</p>

<p>This was the issue: I&rsquo;m writing a DropWizard application. DropWizard uses Jersey. My application needed to take in a POST request and use the post body to make a POST request to a trusted server using HTTPS. But then this error showed up:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR [2015-10-22 20:41:23,405] io.dropwizard.jersey.errors.LoggingExceptionMapper: Error handling a request: 8d10b79e51bbb14d
! java.lang.IllegalStateException: AlreadyConnected
! at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpsUrlConnection.setRequestProperty(Unknown Source)...
</code></pre>

<p>After doing a little Googling, I found out that the exception is mislabeled. Jersey shouldn&rsquo;t be throwing an IllegalStateException. It should be a SSLHandshakeException. Ok, so the question is: What&rsquo;s the workaround? We need to get Jersey (version 2) to accept a self-signed SSL certificate. This requires creating a class with a method we can call to help build a client with the needed configurations. I created this class exactly as Aleksandr Panzin demonstrated <a href="https://gist.github.com/JAlexoid/b15dba31e5919586ae51">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once I added the <code>JerseyWithSSL</code> class, I realized, &ldquo;Hey, Aleksandr didn&rsquo;t explain how to actually use it!&rdquo; And so now, I provide to you the complete solution! Back in my resources class, I created a client using the <code>JerseyWithSSL</code> method <code>initClient()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import java.security.KeyManagementException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.client.Client;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig;

@Path("/ticket")
public class Ticket

@POST
public Response createTicket(...) {
    ClientConfig cc = new ClientConfig();
    Client client = null;
    try {
        client = new JerseyWithSSL().initClient(cc);
    } catch (KeyManagementException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) { 
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

// Use client as you need...
</code></pre>

<p>The trick was figuring out what exactly the <code>Configuration</code> parameter was supposed to be in the <code>initClient()</code> method. An instance of <code>ClientConfig</code> did the trick. I&rsquo;m happy to say my application works due to this code! Hopefully, it will help you if you ever come across this error.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m writing this blog post for women who aspire to be software engineers. What is it like on your first day on the job as a software engineer? This is my experience:</p>

<h4>EXCITING!</h4>

<p>I worked hard to get here. I thought graduation day was great, but my first day on the job was truly the reward. Walking into that office this morning was a very proud moment! I love all the firsts of a first day: a new computer, a new workspace, a new project, meeting new people, getting that badge to get in and out of the building (with my face on it!). It was very exciting and made the day fly by!</p>

<h4>CONFUSED!</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that from large corporation to small startup, acronyms are consistently thrown around. On my first day, as we did our daily standup meeting and then a &ldquo;here&rsquo;s an overview of this project,&rdquo; all I could think about was counting up all the acronyms. Every department has an acronym, our project title is an acronym, and let&rsquo;s face it, everything in computer science is an acronym (XML, JSON, REST, API,&hellip;). I accepted that, in time, I&rsquo;d learn who/what all these acronyms stood for.</p>

<h4>SMART!</h4>

<p>Yeah, I did feel pretty smart. I looked through source code, writing down the classes, how they connect, what they (seemingly) do&hellip;and I felt capable! I felt I was trained pretty well at reading code, understanding it, how to look up things I wasn&rsquo;t sure about&hellip;it was great!</p>

<p>My first day on the job as a software engineer was all I hoped it would be. I&rsquo;ll report on my first week in my next blog post!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/PennDiploma.jpg" title="UPenn Diploma" alt="UPenn Diploma"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. I&rsquo;ve earned my Master&rsquo;s in Computer and Information Technology. It&rsquo;s a wonderful and strange feeling. I certainly went out of my comfort zone, learned a new skill set, and loved every minute of it. But of course, I&rsquo;m not done learning yet.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve been job hunting, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn new programming languages while strengthening the ones I know. To be honest, there really isn&rsquo;t one aspect of development that I love over another. I love coding the full stack. I honestly don&rsquo;t care what programming language I&rsquo;m using either (well&hellip;as long as it&rsquo;s not C). I stumbled upon <a href="www.codeeval.com">CodeEval</a>, a website full of programming problems. I decided to do at least one problem each day. At first, I was only doing the problems in Java since that&rsquo;s my strongest language. According to my CodeEval <a href="https://www.codeeval.com/profile/LBecker/">profile</a>, I&rsquo;m one of the top 15% Java developers sitewide (out of 6,000+)! Then I realized this would be a great way to get better at coding in other languages I&rsquo;m interested in. So besides a not-so-little side project in Python/Flask, I decided to start solving CodeEval problems in Python. It&rsquo;s taught me a lot of the ins-and-outs of Python. I really get a kick out of successfully solving some of these intricate coding problems!</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not partial to front-end or back-end development. I truly enjoy doing both. While looking at job descriptions, it seemed to me that many companies might actually benefit from having someone like me - someone who can code Java one day, and JavaScript the next. JavaScript and I have a funny history. Sometimes I love it (you know, when it works) and sometimes I hate it (let&rsquo;s face it - sometimes JS forces you to write ugly code). But with all the frameworks to choose from, JavaScript can be tolerable, even enjoyable. I enrolled in <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. Supposedly, it takes a year to complete, but I&rsquo;m already more than half way through and I just started 2 weeks ago. It was a good brush-up on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. I completed all the JavaScript lessons (through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>) and now I&rsquo;m doing JavaScript &ldquo;bonfires&rdquo; (through Free Code Camp): programming problems to get you familiar with common built-in functions like Array.split(), filter, etc.</p>

<p>As I started completing the JavaScript bonfires, I thought to myself, &ldquo;Hmm, wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to try to solve CodeEval problems in JavaScript?&rdquo;. So I tried&hellip;and I was able to do it! I&rsquo;m the only one in Philadelphia who has solved any CodeEval problem in JavaScript! <strong>I AM THE FIRST!</strong> Currently, I&rsquo;m in 11th place on the Philadelphia All-Time Leaderboard. I plan on getting into the Top 10 this week.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing since I graduated: Improving. Job hunting. I hope the job hunting will end soon, though. As much fun as I&rsquo;m having learning on my own, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to when you&rsquo;re completing a <em>real</em> project with <em>real</em> requirements for a <em>real</em> client. Hopefully my next blog post will be about my first day as a software engineer! Until next time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2015grad.jpg" alt="The Graduate" />
It&rsquo;s been a very long time since I&rsquo;ve updated this blog, so let me fill you in:</p>

<p>CIS 555: I have nearly completed one of the hardest courses in computer science at The University of Pennsylvania. And I&rsquo;ve done really well, even though I totally struggled with some of the assignments (we have to implement what now?). Struggling is good. Struggling means you&rsquo;re learning something. In 4 days, my group and I will demo our search engine that we wrote from the ground up. If we ever get it working in full (fingers crossed!). I was assigned to do the Search Engine and web interface, which is great for me. I like doing a litte bit of everything. I designed the front-end and I do a great job of communicating with databases in AWS to get results, rank them, and display them. I&rsquo;m proud of my code. It&rsquo;s tested, commented, and it works!</p>

<p>Philly Women In Tech Conference: I went to it after I snagged a free ticket. I&rsquo;m really glad I didn&rsquo;t pay for that ticket, because the conference was terrible. There are a lot of women who want to be grouped into the &ldquo;Women In Tech&rdquo; label because, let&rsquo;s face it, that&rsquo;s a pretty sweet label to have. I do believe, however, that women who work for a tech company in a capacity other than engineering (say: an HR rep for a tech company) are NOT &ldquo;Women In Tech.&rdquo; The conference was more about entrepreneurship than technical skills or the climate in the tech industry in Philadelphia. And the women who attended didn&rsquo;t seem like they knew anything about tech at all. One of the sponsors of the conference, TechGirlz, an organization that tries to encourage young girls to go into tech, is stating that tech is not all about knowing how to code. It really bothers me that an organization that should be promoting computer science is now undermining it as a way to attract a wider audience. Tech is definitely about coding and coding is fun!</p>

<p>Graduating in T-12 days: I have my cap and gown. On a daily basis, I get e-mails congratulating me on my achievement and telling me all the last-minute wrap-ups I need to do before Commencement. It seems surreal. I haven&rsquo;t actually started my job search yet. People keep telling me about opportunities and I&rsquo;m just not ready to apply yet. I&rsquo;m still finishing up CIS 555 - that&rsquo;s my main priority. Then I need a little rest because I&rsquo;ve been on edge with due dates pounding me every week for the past 2 years. I&rsquo;ll regain a little sanity and then begin applying to my future employer (whoever that may be).</p>

<p>I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the MCIT program and my professors who have helped me along the way. I am honored to have been chosen for the program and so happy to have successfully completed it. I&rsquo;m excited to see where my degree will take me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My current (and final) course before I graduate has given me a new appreciation for Java packages. As developers, we use them all the time. In some cases, the more packages you know about, the more efficient and readable your code may be and the more sanity you get to keep.</p>

<p>My appreciation for packages has grown because the assignments I&rsquo;ve had to do for this course have basically asked me to build a number of things from scratch:</p>

<ul>
<li>A web server</li>
<li>An HTTP client</li>
<li>A thread pool</li>
<li>A servlet container</li>
<li>An XPath parser</li>
<li>An matcher between an XPath and an XML document.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, someone has already written the code to do all of these things in Java. It&rsquo;s either already built into Java or you can download a jar file to use it. But try writing these things from scratch and you&rsquo;ll find that you begin to write some of the nastiest code you&rsquo;ve ever written. Classes become horribly coupled, but that&rsquo;s the only way to make the application work. For writing your own servlet container, the API that describes the HttpRequest and HttpResponse interface methods is lacking. But it will make you appreciate Tomcat and all the work that went into making it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amusing that as a computer science student, I have been given a repetoire of principles to code by - DRY, KISS, YAGNI - and most of my assignments force me to violate them one way or another. Sure, writing certain functionality from scratch to really understand how things work under the covers is a great learning experience. But it&rsquo;s hardly simple when I could just import a package and use the classes/methods within it. Reinventing the wheel (or the web server, or the XPath parser, etc.) is a lot trickier than you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/comfortzone.jpg" alt="My favorite poster in Towne Building" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started my last course before I graduate in May. Of course, in typical Lori-fashion, I decided to take one of the hardest courses the computer science department at UPenn has to offer: CIS 555 - Internet and Web Systems. Why did I want to take such a hard course? Why not just breeze my way through some easier class instead? Because this class is a true test of all I&rsquo;ve learned in the past year and a half. It will turn all of the things I&rsquo;ve studied and make me apply them in challenging, new ways.</p>

<p>The first assignment is to build a web server from scratch. I have to write EVERYTHING. I can&rsquo;t even use Java&rsquo;s concurrent library to implement a thread pool. I have to do everything myself. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this blog post. Procrastinating? No, not at all. The first step is always to think it through. Make a plan. Then execute. I&rsquo;m in the thinking phase, slowly making a plan.</p>

<p>Which is why I decided to write this blog post. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how crazy it is that I&rsquo;m actually taking this class and doing this assignment. A year and a half ago, I didn&rsquo;t know how to program. I didn&rsquo;t know what a &ldquo;data structure&rdquo; was. I didn&rsquo;t know what an &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; was. I didn&rsquo;t know what a web server was. The internet was MAGIC. Software was MAGIC. Sometimes, I like to think about all the people on their cell phones, tablets, and computers for leisure or business and how they know NOTHING about the work that went into every detail of that device, the OS, and the software they&rsquo;re running. And I do. I do know (sort of) what it takes to make what most people take for granted as they use their gadgets. It&rsquo;s unbelievably impressive! More impressive: I can do these things!</p>

<p>This is really a testament to how great Penn&rsquo;s program is. The kid gloves were off before I stepped into my first class. I wanted to learn computer science and I was (as) ready (as I could be) for the challenge. I was worried, though. Could my professors really teach a photographer/English teacher how to write code? Yes, and they did. There were times when I felt like I was drowning, but I kept kicking. I went to sleep and found myself coding in my dreams (good code, too! Code I could use when I woke up!).</p>

<p>For anyone who thinks they don&rsquo;t fit the mold (mould for you UKers) for a particulary area of study, who thinks they&rsquo;re too old to learn something completely new &ndash; you can. It takes some getting used to when you&rsquo;re out of your comfort zone. But that&rsquo;s how you grow. That&rsquo;s how I got to where I am now.</p>

<p>What a difference a year and a half can make.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Lulled Into A False Sense of Security</h3>

<p>It seems to happen every day and the public is appalled for about one second before it&rsquo;s back to business as usual. I&rsquo;m talking about hacking, not in the &ldquo;finding creative solutions&rdquo; sense, but the finding and exploiting of software vulnerabilities. Sony got hacked. Private e-mails and documents were released in retaliation for an &ldquo;unflattering&rdquo; movie about North Korea (supposedly). In past years, the big box stores have been hacked again and again. Customer credit card numbers were stolen. Still, people continue to swipe their credit cards at Target and Home Depot without blinking an eye.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not serious about software security. The public doesn&rsquo;t care enough to change their habits and pressure companies to store their data safely and securely. And what can these companies do when they&rsquo;re at the mercy of the software company that developed the software they use?  Most software companies don&rsquo;t seem to care about exploits, unless it comes to their legal team, in which case, they&rsquo;ve already placed a disclaimer that using this software is at your own risk. So, these breaches seem to be par for the course. No one really takes responsibility. Another day, another hack.</p>

<h3>Universities: Software Security is a Choice, Not a Requirement</h3>

<p>This semester, I took a software engineering course which centered around the internal and external metrics of software quality as defined by ISO-9126. One of the external metrics was security. For software to be considered secure, it has to verify data is only accessible by authorized users and that code cannot be manipulated by outside sources. My professor showed us a few ways we could exploit programs in Java. Suddenly, everyone in the class realized how all the programs we&rsquo;d written throughout our careers as students (and possibly during our internships) were horribly insecure (Thanks, Java. Why SecurityManager is disabled by default, I&rsquo;ll never understand). And this was just in Java. What back doors exist in other programming languages?</p>

<p>Most university computer science programs have a computer and network security course. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s usually an elective rather than a required course. Just do a Google search for &ldquo;required computer science courses&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll see a list of university web sites, all of which list computer security as an elective course.</p>

<p>Digging further, what do students who take these computer security courses actually learn? Examining a wide variety of universities, the descriptions of these courses vary greatly. Some, like the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/catalog/2013-14/courses/engr/b-csci/4133-security-laboratory">University of Colorado Boulder</a> give students hands-on experiences with finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. Right next door, <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs556/">Colorado State University&rsquo;s</a> computer security course states, &ldquo;In this course, we will begin by investigating some of the security measures that can be employed to safeguard information. For the most part we will look into the theory that goes into designing these measures rather than studying security tools and techniques. This is primarily because there are too many of those tools out there and they are changing frequently.&rdquo; Does a course that focuses more on theory than practice do a disservice to future software developers? Will Colorado State University&rsquo;s students create programs be as secure as say, the ones created by UC Boulder students who took Security Laboratory?</p>

<h3>Untraditional Routes: Learn To Code, Not Learn To Code Securely</h3>

<p>More and more people are taking different, untraditional routes into computer science. While it seems that teaching students how to write secure software is optional at the university level, these other paths into computer science seem to offer no instruction about writing secure software. Take, for example, the well-respected Flatiron School in New York. Nowhere in their <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/">curriculum</a> do they discuss security. The focus is on learning new technologies and writing code that works. Their graduates go off to work at well-known companies, just like university students, none-the-wiser about writing secure code.</p>

<p>Many other people are taking advantage of free online courses to teach themselves how to code. They could take this Coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec">course</a> on computer security, but the recommended background is for someone with a solid foundation in computer science, not someone trying to learn computer science on their own. I&rsquo;ll bet most self-learners won&rsquo;t be considering this course. The question is, will those already entrenched in computer science be motivated to take this course?</p>

<h3>Software Security is an Afterthought</h3>

<p>Without making software security a priority in our educational institutions and for hiring qualified software engineers, software will continue to be vulnerable to many preventable attacks. It&rsquo;s impossible to have an inpenetrable program. But there is so much we could do to make software more secure. If only there was some initiative on behalf of universities and other computer science-based schools to produce software developers who are knowledgeable in writing programs with some basic security measures in mind. And there needs to be more initiative on the part of companies to not only hire developers that are qualified to write working, secure code, but to take responsibility when their software leaks out sensitive information. As more and more of our lives become digitized, security should become a top priority, not an afterthought.</p>

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/dvorak.jpg" title="Dvorak keyboard" alt="Dvorak keyboard"></p>

<p>If you do a considerable amount of typing on a daily basis and have experienced stiffness or pain in the joints of your fingers, this post is for you. I used to have these problems, but a rather simple switch made all the difference.</p>

<h3>What is Dvorak?</h3>

<p>Dvorak is a keyboard layout in which the most commonly typed letters are on the home row. The layout was meant to increase typing speed and decrease typing fatigue. Dr. August Dvorak, a psychologist, and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, did extensive research on how people typed using the standard QWERTY keyboard. Dvorak thought QWERTY was inefficient and burdensome for users. In QWERTY, typing the most used letters requires users to move up or down from the home row and puts more emphasis on typing with the left hand. So, Dvorak and Dealey came up with the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard to tackle these inefficiencies.</p>

<h3>How Hard Was It To Learn?</h3>

<p>I typed in QWERTY for most of my life. I&rsquo;m sure many of you will remember being in elementary or middle school and taking a typing class where the teacher would call out letters and you&rsquo;d press the corresponding keys. Or maybe you played some typing game where you had to type &ldquo;garbage words&rdquo; as fast as you could and see if you could beat your best words per minute score.</p>

<p>Dvorak is not any different. You need to learn where the letters are and you need to practice. I found it easiest to buy some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SIMPLIFIED-KEYBOARD-LETTERING-TRANSPARENT-BACKGROUND/dp/B0011FI3O8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416080332&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dvorak+keyboard+stickers">Dvorak keyboard stickers</a> so I could look down at the keys to see where all the letters were until I could touch-type in Dvorak. I found a <a href="http://gigliwood.com/abcd/lessons/">nice website</a> to practice learning where the keys were and gain some speed. And I went cold-turkey and typed in Dvorak for work and home computer activities. In 2 weeks, I was typing 40 wpm and Dvorak seemed rather normal. After a year and a half of typing in Dvorak, I type about 80 wpm and I have exceptional accuracy &ndash; almost 99% according to the typing test I just took &ndash; and that&rsquo;s comparable or better to what I typed using QWERTY.</p>

<h3>Why Bother Learning Dvorak?</h3>

<p>The main benefit of learning Dvorak for me was to reduce finger joint pain. I once worked as a processing associate, a nice title for sitting in a cubicle all day and transcribing loads of documents into 3 different databases. I typed all day long, fingers glued to the keyboard. A year into that job, I had to go to an occupational therapist because I had extreme pain in my fingers to the point that I could not bend them at the joints. The therapist said my joints were swollen due to typing so much and that the best way to relieve the swelling was just not to type! Obviously, that wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>

<p>I tried all sorts of &ldquo;ergonomic&rdquo; things to help alleviate pain caused by constant typing. I wore <a href="http://www.imakproducts.com/product.php?c=Wrist+/+Carpal+Tunnel&amp;s=10">wrist gloves</a> and had gel pads for the keyboard and mouse. I received a special keyboard at work with soft-press keys. But none of those things had any effect.</p>

<p>So, I learned Dvorak. Now, I type for at least 10 hours per day, every day, and I have not experienced the pain and stiffness in my fingers that I had as a processing associate. Dvorak was right: putting the important keys on the home row and dispersing what keys are pressed evenly between the left and right hand reduces finger/wrist strain. I&rsquo;ve never looked back on my decision to switch. It really helped me continue typing comfortably.</p>

<h3>What are Dvorak&rsquo;s Drawbacks?</h3>

<p>Well, for one, you&rsquo;ll selectively forget QWERTY. I can&rsquo;t touch-type in QWERTY anymore. Sit me at a computer with its keyboard set to QWERTY (which is the default keyboard layout, of course) and I&rsquo;m like a 5 year old pressing keys with my index finger when I find the key with the right letter on it. But I did say that forgetting QWERTY is <strong>selective</strong>. I can oddly type on a QWERTY keyboard no problem&ndash;wait for it&ndash;on my cell phone. Yes, that&rsquo;s right - the keyboard that pops up on my phone is in standard QWERTY and I have no issues swiping words or pressing individual letters. I oddly know where the letters reside even though I can&rsquo;t do this when sitting in front of an actual keyboard. I have no idea why this happens.</p>

<p>The second drawback is that there are other keyboard layouts out there that are specifically designed to alleviate repetitive strain injuries. They may be better than Dvorak. I&rsquo;ve never used them. Learning a second layout was enough for me…and it&rsquo;s one that is supported by most operating systems unlike some of these other layouts designed to help RSI.</p>

<p>The third drawback you might not even consider a drawback - other people can&rsquo;t type on your computer. So, if you do a lot of collaboration on your computer, you&rsquo;ll have to switch the keyboard back to QWERTY for those other users to type. But it is a lot of fun to hand someone your computer when the keyboard layout is set to Dvorak and see the havoc unfold as your colleague types in something and cannot understand why the computer spits out gibberish!</p>

<h3>Why I Love Dvorak</h3>

<p>The number one reason I love typing in Dvorak is, of course, that I am comfortable and pain-free. While there are some studies out there that dispute Dvorak&rsquo;s ability to alleviate RSI, it sure has for me. I enjoy knowing that someone can watch me type in my password, but they&rsquo;ll never know what it is just by watching what keys I press. I enjoy the fact that others cannot really use my computer because Dvorak keeps them from doing anything that cannot be accomplished without the keyboard. To sum it up, it&rsquo;s good for my health and my digital security. And it might be good for yours, too!</p>
