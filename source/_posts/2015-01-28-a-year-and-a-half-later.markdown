![My favorite poster in Towne Building]( /images/comfortzone.jpg)

I've started my last course before I graduate in May. Of course, in typical Lori-fashion, I decided to take one of the hardest courses the computer science department at UPenn has to offer: CIS 555 - Internet and Web Systems. Why did I want to take such a hard course? Why not just breeze my way through some easier class instead? Because this class is a true test of all I've learned in the past year and a half. It will turn all of the things I've studied and make me apply them in challenging, new ways.

The first assignment is to build a web server from scratch. I have to write EVERYTHING. I can't even use Java's concurrent library to implement a thread pool. I have to do everything myself. That's why I'm writing this blog post. Procrastinating? No, not at all. The first step is always to think it through. Make a plan. Then execute. I'm in the thinking phase, slowly making a plan.

Which is why I decided to write this blog post. I couldn't help but think about how crazy it is that I'm actually taking this class and doing this assignment. A year and a half ago, I didn't know how to program. I didn't know what a "data structure" was. I didn't know what an "algorithm" was. I didn't know what a web server was. The internet was MAGIC. Software was MAGIC. Sometimes, I like to think about all the people on their cell phones, tablets, and computers for leisure or business and how they know NOTHING about the work that went into every detail of that device, the OS, and the software they're running. And I do. I do know (sort of) what it takes to make what most people take for granted as they use their gadgets. It's unbelievably impressive! More impressive: I can do these things!

This is really a testament to how great Penn's program is. The kid gloves were off before I stepped into my first class. I wanted to learn computer science and I was (as) ready (as I could be) for the challenge. I was worried, though. Could my professors really teach a photographer/English teacher how to write code? Yes, and they did. There were times when I felt like I was drowning, but I kept kicking. I went to sleep and found myself coding in my dreams (good code, too! Code I could use when I woke up!).

For anyone who thinks they don't fit the mold (mould for you UKers) for a particulary area of study, who thinks they're too old to learn something completely new -- you can. It takes some getting used to when you're out of your comfort zone. But that's how you grow. That's how I got to where I am now.

What a difference a year and a half can make.
