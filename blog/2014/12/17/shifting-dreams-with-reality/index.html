<div class="entry-content"><h3>No Career Guidance For Young Adults</h3>

<p>Around 16 years of age, most teenagers in America begin realizing that high school is ending soon and they&rsquo;ll need to plan for the next phase of their life. Will they go to college, a trade school, or try to find immediate employment? Some schools provide little guidance for students when it comes to this type of planning. It&rsquo;s usually due to a lack of resources (too many students per guidance <a href="https://www.schoolcounselor.org/asca/media/asca/home/Ratios10-11.pdf">counselor</a>, if there is one). Being a guidance counselor is a tough job, particularly when it comes to providing career advice. Job reports come out all the time that mention sectors where job growth is expected to rise or decline. These reports tend to conflict with one another (See such reports as: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/05/there-is-in-fact-a-tech-talent-shortage-and-there-always-will-be/">There is a shortage of tech-talent</a> vs. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-24/the-tech-worker-shortage-doesnt-really-exist">The STEM Shortage is a Myth</a>). So how can guidance counselors honestly speak to the prospects of getting a career in a certain field to their students? In addition, most guidance counselors, for fear of dealing with disgruntled parents, will not be honest about whether a student can really handle or achieve a career in a particular field.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just guidance counselors to blame for the lack of educating students on career choices. Parents are also undereducated about the economy, at times biased towards having their children &ldquo;follow in their footsteps&rdquo;, and others are not ready to be honest and crush the unrealisitc career dreams of their children. After all, parents want to believe that their child is the one in a million who makes it!</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>

<p>At 16, I wanted to be a photographer. I had taken a photography class for all 4 years of high school. I was &ldquo;good&rdquo; at it (read: I got an A in the course) and I&rsquo;d won some awards for my images. When it was time to pick a career, I felt I had two options: writer or photographer. I loved writing and wrote hundred page novels by hand, but I never won any awards for my writing. I thought getting a career in writing was as likely as getting the lead in a Broadway show. At least if I studied photography in college, I could always be a wedding photographer and make a decent living.</p>

<p>No one talked me out of it. My parents were supportive. My teachers and guidance counselor liked my choice of career (&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be wonderful!&rdquo;). The reality was being a photographer was a tough job, it didn&rsquo;t pay well, didn&rsquo;t have a steady income, it had long, unpredictable hours, and with the invention of digital photography, the demand for needing a professional photographer was deteriorating.</p>

<p>I graduated with a 4 year Bachelor of Science in Photography! My first photography job was in a well-known studio. They paid me $10 an hour, a salary I thought was not exactly a fair wage for someone with a college education. I looked elsewhere, but the wages were still low because &ldquo;anyone can do photography.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went back to college, this time to be an English teacher. I picked this career choice, because I&rsquo;d still be pursuing a passion of mine and after doing my research, found that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said high school teachers were in demand. When I graduated (again), I discovered this was not the case at all. Teachers were retiring, but schools were not filling those positions. In addition, schools were laying off teachers, making competition for open positions an enormous uphill battle. Even with my research, I was still unable to find full-time work.</p>
