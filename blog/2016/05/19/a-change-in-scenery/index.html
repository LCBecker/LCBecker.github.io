<div class="entry-content"><p>I started a new job in the beginning of April. My first job as a software engineer, though, will always have a special spot in my heart. I accepted my first software engineering role because a) I&rsquo;d be working for a well-known company with a prominent reputation in the tech space and b) I really needed some hands-on experience. My only experience prior to my first job was a summer internship at a start-up, where I really had no clue what the heck was going on. <em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an API?&rdquo;</em> Haha! There&rsquo;s quite a gap between learning software development in a university classroom and actually building applications for a business.</p>

<h3>My First Job</h3>

<p>My first job served its purpose. I am very proud of the projects I completed, the technologies I learned on the job, and the social skills I acquired in order to deploy my work. Seriously, social skills in the office are highly underrated! I leaned on my co-workers a lot so I could understand how to do Jenkins deployments, merging changes in Github, and running applications in Docker containers. My boss was very hands-off. He generally told me what to build and it was up to me to build it. I was a very competent developer, though. UPenn and my true mentor (my husband) prepared me well and I made short work of most of my projects! After a month or so into the job, my boss trusted me enough to allow me to select which technologies to use for my projects. I became an AngularJS master! I was really grateful that I was able to do full-stack development there. Some people like front-end dev, others like back-end, but I&rsquo;ve never wanted to choose between the two. I like the challenges of both.</p>

<h3>Honest Job Searching</h3>

<p>If your first job is your dream job, you&rsquo;re probably very, very lucky! While I liked my first job, there were some hard truths that I&rsquo;d come to realize as I sat in my cubicle. What makes a fulfilling career? I wanted my next job to make me really happy to come to work. I didn&rsquo;t want just a paycheck. I&rsquo;m giving up 40+ hours of my life every week and I wanted those 40+ hours to count for something other than dollars. My first job was really just a job. I wasn&rsquo;t unhappy, but I wasn&rsquo;t exactly joyful either. There was a slowdown of projects and I was bored. I knew that I wanted my next job to have lots of work to keep me busy and engaged! I also wanted the option to work from home. I really hated that office. I had a terribly uncomfortable chair, noisy cubicle neighbors, and I felt alone in the cubicle maze. Software development is a pretty sweet career - it CAN be done at home. And I wanted to be in the comfort of my home some days, sitting on my comfortable couch in the peaceful quiet thoughtfully writing code. When I earnestly started my job search, I told my recruiter that I was looking for a full-stack position with the ability to work from home. And she found a great company for me!</p>

<h3>My New Job</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about where I am right now! I think I&rsquo;m the happiest I&rsquo;ve ever been! I truly <em>LOVE</em> my new job! The people I work with are really fun people. There&rsquo;s a nice culture in the office where people say hello to one another in the morning, chat casually in Slack, and go out to lunch together! It&rsquo;s an open office, which I thought I would come to hate, but it&rsquo;s actually grown on me. I truly feel like I&rsquo;m part of the team (♪♪ everything is awesome&hellip;. ♪♪). The product I&rsquo;m improving and building out is <em>really</em> interesting and has a lot going for it! I&rsquo;m definitely challenged by the large codebase and I celebrate every time I fix a bug or make an improvement. Raising my hands in victory a few times a week feels very, very good! I work from home some days and that&rsquo;s really improved my quality of life. I can really get in the zone at home. There&rsquo;s no need for putting on headphones with white noise playing in the background. And it&rsquo;s also nice to &lsquo;work&rsquo; with my favorite coding partner: my dog!</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting out in software engineering, don&rsquo;t be discouraged by being told you don&rsquo;t have enough experience. An opportunity will come your way and you&rsquo;ll make the best of it. When you&rsquo;re ready to move on, be honest about what you want. It <em>is</em> achievable!</p>
