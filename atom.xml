<p>So, how&rsquo;s my new Kinesis FreeStyle2 keyboard? Is it as ergonomical as I need it to be relieve my RSI symptoms? Would it work well for you? Read on!</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p>I started my work day setting up the FreeStyle2 with the the VIP3 accessory kit. It took about 10 minutes, because I actually read directions :-P The wrist rests and the lifts snapped in nice and easy! I decided to use the largest angle, 15 degrees, for the lift. The more vertical it is, the more like that handshake position that&rsquo;s supposed to be ideal.</p>

<h4>Benefits of a Split Keyboard</h4>

<p>There are so many benefits of having a split keyboard. For one, my arms were so much more relaxed. Not only did it help my arms, but my back as well!</p>

<p>One surprising benefit of the split keyboard: the space in the middle! I was able to put my steno pad front and center! No longer was it off to the side so I&rsquo;d have to keep pivoting to look at my notes!</p>

<h4>Hotkey Blunder</h4>

<p>One of the things I was really looking forward having on the FreeStyle2 were the special keys on the left key panel. There are a variety of hotkeys including copy, paste, and select all. No more Command+C! So, as I was working, I found myself in situations that required copying and pasting text. Time to use the hotkeys! So, I highlighted some text, pressed the Copy hotkey&hellip;.and heard a &ldquo;ERRRR&rdquo; noise out of my headphones. I started pressing a variety of hotkeys and each one did not do as it was expected. One of the keys put Google Chrome in background mode (who knew Chome had such a thing as background mode?) and the others force quit some of my applications! YIKES!</p>

<p>I searched online, but no one reported issues with this keyboard&rsquo;s hotkeys. That could only mean one thing: Dvorak. I switched over to the Dvorak-Qwerty setting on my Mac and TA DA, the hotkeys worked!!!</p>

<h3>Week 1+</h3>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been one week of using my Kinesis keyboard. Some things have definitely changed since Day 1. Let&rsquo;s review:</p>

<h4>Goodbye, Hotkeys</h4>

<p>The hotkeys are still buggy. Really buggy. After switching to Dvorak-Qwerty, they worked, but only in certain applications. They didn&rsquo;t work in my main code editor, Eclipse. The applications where they did work made other Command+keys stopped working––one of which was the all important Command+S (Save). In my Atom editor, I apparently re-assigned keypresses by pressing Command+S. OOPS! Needless to say, I decided to go back to regular Dvorak, making the hotkeys useless again. At least I can actually save my work now.</p>

<h4>Tilt Good? Tilt Bad?</h4>

<p>I can&rsquo;t decide whether the 15 degree tilt is comfortable or not. I&rsquo;ve been experimenting now with the 10 degree tilt. I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;s actually beneficial. The jury is still out on this one.</p>

<h4>Where Should My Mouse Go?</h4>

<p>I think this is the most fundamentally troubling question I&rsquo;ve been trying to answer this past week. The split keyboard makes my arms nice and comfortable, but only when <strong>typing</strong>. But my mouse is farther away, meaning I need to lean over to do all my clicking, moving of arrows, and scrolling. After a day or two of my new configuration, my right shoulder was really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>For a few days, I tried putting my mouse in the middle, between the two keyboard pads. But this is sadly also uncomfortable. It kind of negates the reason why I wanted a split keyboard in the first place&hellip;so my arms would not be at some unnatural angle in front of my body.</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve tried doing as much as I can via the keyboard. I&rsquo;ve started learning the keypresses needed to toggle between tabs and applications. I&rsquo;ve used the page-down keys more for scrolling down on webpages. It&rsquo;s better than constantly reaching for the mouse. But the mouse is still essential and it&rsquo;s hard to know what else I can do to make using it more comfortable.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m still very happy with my Kinesis FreeStyle2 purchase.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It really has helped a lot with my wrist, arm, shoulder and finger pain.</li>
<li>That space in between the keypads is great for a notebook!</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no learning curve to use it. It&rsquo;s a regular keyboard, just in a split configuration!</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your mouse will be further away due to the split. There&rsquo;s probably no place to put your mouse in a comfortable position. You&rsquo;ll need to try learning more key shortcuts to do things you&rsquo;d normally do with your mouse so you don&rsquo;t need to reach for your mouse as much.</li>
<li>If you type in Dvorak, the hotkeys are useless.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2016/02/16/a-rant-about-ergonomics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/kinesis.jpg" title="kinesis keyboard" alt="kinesis keyboard"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about ergonomics lately. A few weeks ago, I thought I was dreaming as I looked down and saw that my little finger&rsquo;s bone had somehow managed to overlap my ring finger&rsquo;s bone. My hand looked like a claw! I had to use my other hand to set my finger bones back in shape.</p>

<p>I knew I had to do something. I love software engineering, but let&rsquo;s face it––it&rsquo;s sort of a crippling job. Sitting all day: Not good. Typing/mousing all day: Not good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written <a href="http://lcbecker.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/why-i-type-in-dvorak/">before</a> about how switching to Dvorak helped alleviate my RSI. But clearly, it was back. A simple search discovered that the Apple Magic Bluetooth keyboard is absolutely AWFUL for RSI. Time for a new keyboard&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ye Old Keyboard</h3>

<p>First, I brought my old Logitech keyboard to work. This poor keyboard has been sitting collecting dust in front of my desktop (which was last turned on&hellip;hmm&hellip;3 years ago?). Right away, there was a problem––the number pad on the right. I felt like my mouse was so far away and my right arm was forced to be at a 60 degree angle from my body to type. Awkward!</p>

<h3>The Kinesis Classic QD</h3>

<p>Thankfully, a friend allowed me to borrow his Kinesis Classic QD keyboard (pictured above) to get a feel for it. He swears by it after suffering himself from RSI and has been using it for years! This is probably one of the strangest keyboards I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but it has a lot going for it. The wrist pads are perfectly positioned. The inset wells for the keys puts your fingers at a natural downward tilt. And what I loved most of all––the division between left and right puts your arms perpendicular to your body, which is way more comfortable than having them angled to the middle of your body! It also has the keys you probably press the most pushed to the thumb regions. The keys can be remapped in whatever configuration you prefer.</p>

<p>After trying the Kinesis Classic (newer versions are called the <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/">Advantage</a>) for a week, it was clear what I loved and hated about this keyboard. And what I hated was the key configurations. I have tiny hands, so using any of the thumb buttons was actually putting a lot of strain on my wrists to twist and reach those buttons. Even though I could remap keys, it was really difficult getting used to pressing keys that I was used to being placed in areas of the keyboard that no longer existed in the Kinesis key layout. Yet, this trial run was enough to convince me that Kinesis was on to something&hellip;</p>

<h3>The Kinesis FreeStyle2</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write a post about my experiences with this keyboard once I get it later this week. However, I think the Kinesis <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-mac/">FreeStyle2</a> has everything I loved about the Classic without all the things I disliked. I bought the 20&#8221; extension for that great left/right arm separation. I also purchased the optional VIP3 accessory package that allows you to vertically tilt the keyboard. Supposedly, the &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; position is better for your wrists and arms. If you have pain in your lower arm, this might be great for you. The VIP3 also comes with Kinesis&#8217; awesome wrist pads (seriously, they&rsquo;re worth raving about!).</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/12/18/interactive-svgs-in-angularjs/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-18T18:28:47-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/12/18/interactive-svgs-in-angularjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/dvorak.jpg" title="Dvorak keyboard" alt="Dvorak keyboard"></p>

<p>My latest project has been utilizing my art degree (wait, what? An art degree is useful as a software engineer? Surprisingly, YES). Using Inkscape, I created a very customized keyboard as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). There were two things I had to do with this file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Embed the SVG into a view inside my AngularJS application.</li>
<li>Each key element/node needed an <code>ng-click</code> attribute so when it was pressed, something would happen. Because, you know, what good is a key if you can&rsquo;t click on it?</li>
</ol>


<p>As I discovered, these two tasks are a lot harder than they should be. Putting an SVG into a view is as simple as making the file path the <code>data</code> of an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> in the HTML. You can add an <code>ng-click</code> to the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, but that only works if you want the entire SVG to be clickable. I wanted interactivity <em>inside</em> the SVG itself. Adding <code>ng-click</code> as an attribute within a node in the SVG file will NOT work! To do what I wanted, I neede to use directives to embed the SVG in the view and attach a <code>ng-click</code> attribute to each of my keys.</p>

<p>I found <a href="" title="https://goo.gl/3s3Vlu">this site</a> that had an interactive map and thought, &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s kind of similar to what I want to do!&rdquo; So, using their insights, I was able to make a clickable keyboard within my AngularJS application. Here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>

<h3>Add A Class and Unique ID to SVG Nodes</h3>

<p>My keys were mainly circle elements with some text on top. I flattened my SVG to one layer to ensure that when a user clicked anywhere inside the circle element, it would trigger a click event. I added a class to each circle element and also updated the id of each circle element to reference its value, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;circle
    r="43"
    cy="569"
    cx="227"
    style="fill:#4d4d4d;stroke:#000000;stroke-width:3"
    id="btn_MENU"
    class="boardKeys" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Make Two Directives</h3>

<p>I just put both directives in the same file: keyDirectives.js.</p>

<p>Directive One: Embed the SVG.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var myApp = angular.module('KeyboardAppModule');

myApp.directive('svgKeys', ['$compile', function($compile) {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        templateUrl: 'images/keyboard.svg',
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
            var keys = element[0].querySelectorAll('.boardKeys');
            angular.forEach(keys, function(path, key) {
            var myKey = angular.element(path);
            myKey.attr("myKey", "");
            $compile(myKey)(scope);
            })
        }
    }
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice these details: <code>var keys</code> is an array of all elements with the class <code>boardKeys</code>&hellip;the same class I attached to each circle element (key) inside my SVG. For each of these circles, the directive adds the attribute <code>myKey</code> which is really the name of Directive Two. Directive Two is then initiated. But first, since I now have the directive that places the SVG into the view, take a look at the view&rsquo;s HTML:</p>

<pre><code class="html">    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"&gt;
            &lt;div svgKeys&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>See how I just threw that directive in there? That&rsquo;ll just embed the SVG in that div! Woohoo! But wait, I still need to register clicking a key.</p>

<p>Directive Two: Add <code>ng-click</code> to all keys.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">myApp.directive('myKey', ['$compile', function($compile) {
    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        scope: true,
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
            scope.elementId = element.attr("id");
            scope.keyClick = function() {
                scope.pressKey(scope.elementId);
            };
            element.attr("ng-click", "keyClick()");
            element.removeAttr("myKey");
            $compile(element)(scope);
        }
    }
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>So, Directive One added the <code>myKey</code> directive to each key, which then calls Directive Two, which adds the <code>ng-click</code> attribute to each key. For me, I used a function called <code>pressKey()</code> in my controller. It&rsquo;s accessible via scope and I felt that my controller is where someone would look to see what happens when a button is clicked. You could just as well define what should happen when a key is clicked here in the directive. Also notice that I pass <code>scope.elementId</code> to my <code>pressKey</code> function. <code>scope.elementId</code> is the key&rsquo;s ID! So, now I know <em>which</em> key was clicked and can handle the case as needed!</p>

<h3>FIN</h3>

<p>It obviously doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of code to make an SVG file&rsquo;s elements interactive in Angular, but it&rsquo;s certainly not intuitive. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s great that this code works and I&rsquo;m excited for my next Angular application with interactive SVGs!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/metrics.jpg" title="metrics art" alt="metrics art"></p>

<h6>IO Graph Art by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanmac87/4415951740">nathanmac87</a></h6>

<p><strong>Post revised 11/23/2015 for correctness. Thank you to Jan-Olav Eide and Tim Bart for leading me in the right direction!</strong></p>

<p>My most recent project at work has been to utilize DropWizard metrics to gather information about an application I built and send that data to Graphite to display in a realtime dashboard. As I normally do, I reviewed the documentation for <a href="https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/getting-started/">Dropwizard Metrics</a>, but as usual, there was a lot to be desired. Their example did not go into the nitty gritty of <em>how</em> to connect everything together. The internet was also silent on how to actually use DropWizard metrics.</p>

<p>So here is my tutorial on how <em>I</em> was able to get DropWizard metrics up and running in my application:</p>

<h3>1. Maven Application? Update pom.xml</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a Maven application, you&rsquo;ll need to add metrics-core as a dependency. If you&rsquo;re using some sort of special reporter like Graphite, you may need to add additional dependencies. This was what I had to add to my pom:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.dropwizard.metrics&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metrics-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.dropwizard.metrics&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metrics-graphite&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.dropwizard&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;dropwizard-metrics-graphite&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.9.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Start Your Metrics On Application Startup</h3>

<p>Supposedly, there are two ways you can initialize your metrics reporters. A reporter sends your data to either the console, logger, Graphite, or other DropWizard-approved outputs. You can either specify them in your config.yml file, as seen <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29432586/dropwizard-yaml-for-graphite-server-configuration">here</a>. This is supposed to start reporting your metrics automatically when you start your application. I tried this method, but I had zero luck with it. I ended up getting some parsing error from within DropWizard&rsquo;s validation library.</p>

<p>So, I initialized my metrics an alternative way&ndash; in the <code>run()</code> method of my application class. DropWizard&rsquo;s environment already creates a <code>MetricRegistry</code> object on startup. This object manages all of our metrics (these are timers, counters, meters, histograms, and gauges). Since I added metrics to my resources class, I needed to pass that <code>MetricRegistry</code> object to my resource class. This is how my application class looked:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyApplication extends Application&lt;MyConfiguration&gt;{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new MyApplication().run(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(MyConfiguration config, Environment env) throws Exception {

        final Graphite graphite = new Graphite(new InetSocketAddress("my.graphite.host", 2003));

        final GraphiteReporter reporter = GraphiteReporter.forRegistry(env.metrics())
            .prefixedWith("upToYou")
            .convertRatesTo(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .convertDurationsTo(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
            .filter(MetricFilter.ALL)
            .build(graphite);
        reporter.start(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        environment.jersey().register(new MyResource(env.metrics()));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some things to note: The <code>prefixedWith</code> is not required. What this does is append a label in front of our metrics names. I&rsquo;ll explain this more in Step 3.</p>

<h3>3. Add Metrics To Your Resources</h3>

<p>I wanted metrics like &lsquo;How many requests are we getting at /path1&rsquo; and &lsquo;How long is it taking for the method handling /path1 to return a response&rsquo;. Chances are you are, too. In order to do this, we&rsquo;ll need to add metrics to our resources. And those metrics need to be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; in the <code>MetricRegistry</code> from Step 2. So we&rsquo;ll need to create a constructor for our resource that will take in the <code>MetricRegistry</code> object we passed in Step 2.</p>

<p>There are two ways to add metrics to your resources: using annotations and by actually creating objects of a metrics class. I&rsquo;ll give you an example of both:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyResource {
     MetricRegistry metrics;
     Meter requestCount;

     public MyResource(MetricRegistry registry) {
        this.metrics = registry;
        requestCount = metrics.meter(MetricRegister.name("requestCount"));
     }

     @POST
     @Path("/path1")
     @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
     @Timed(absolute=true, name="requestRuntime")
     public Response handleRequest() {
        requestCount.mark();
        return Response.ok("Hello World").build(); //you know what I mean...
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice these details:</p>

<ul>
<li>We declare the meter <code>requestCount</code>, which will give us the total count of all calls made to /path1 and how many requests /path1 gets in 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15 minute timeframes. We initialized this <code>Meter</code> object in our Resource constructor, It&rsquo;s initialization uses our <code>MetricRegistry</code> so it can manage it accordingly.</li>
<li>See the <code>@Timed</code> annotation? DropWizard will automatically create a timer and whenever <code>handleRequest()</code> is called, the timer will record how long it takes to complete this method. We do not need to initialize a timer object ourselves. We can name this timer. I&rsquo;ve added the <code>absolute=true</code> field, because otherwise, the entire path of this metric in Graphite will be my prefix + package path + class + requestRuntime. Too long! By setting absolute to true, the metric path is just the prefix + the metric name.</li>
<li>Remember in Step 2 when we saw that <code>.prefixedWith("upToYou")</code>? Basically, our reporter, whether Graphite or the console or something else, will refer to this metric by the prefix + name of the metric. Graphite showed me options to graph like, &ldquo;upToYou.requestCount.count&rdquo; and &ldquo;upToYou.requestCount.mean&rdquo; (the &lsquo;count&rsquo; and &lsquo;mean&rsquo; part are automatically attached by DropWizard metrics). You don&rsquo;t need any prefix, but if you want it, go for it back in Step 2.</li>
<li>Finally, we call our meter&rsquo;s <code>mark()</code> method. That tells the metric, &ldquo;Hey, the method we&rsquo;re tracking has been called! Increment the meter count!&rdquo; The <code>mark()</code> method is for the meter metric, though. Please refer to the <a href="https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/getting-started/">DropWizard Metrics</a> documentation on how to initialize and call counters, histograms, and other metrics. Now, here we&rsquo;ve programmatically called the meter&rsquo;s method. We don&rsquo;t have to do that. We could just use the annotation <code>@Metered(absolute=true, name="myMeter")</code> and DropWizard would automatically call <code>mark()</code> for us whenever our method was called. But this is how you would do it if you wanted additional control&hellip;or multiple meters on a single method.</li>
</ul>


<h3>4. Profit</h3>

<p>Now, when we start up our application, our metrics will be monitoring what we want and sending data to the console or Graphite or wherever!</p>

<p>So, there you have it! This is how everything ties together in DropWizard Metrics! And I&rsquo;m the first person to actually write an example of this! Woohoo! I hope you have enjoyed this post and that it&rsquo;s given you a decent amount of confidence to use DropWizard metrics in your application! Happy Coding!</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/https-with-jersey/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-26T20:16:51-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/https-with-jersey</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am so excited about this post! It&rsquo;s a technical post! With code! I wanted to write this to help others who might find themselves in the same predicament.</p>

<p>This was the issue: I&rsquo;m writing a DropWizard application. DropWizard uses Jersey. My application needed to take in a POST request and use the post body to make a POST request to a trusted server using HTTPS. But then this error showed up:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR [2015-10-22 20:41:23,405] io.dropwizard.jersey.errors.LoggingExceptionMapper: Error handling a request: 8d10b79e51bbb14d
! java.lang.IllegalStateException: AlreadyConnected
! at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpsUrlConnection.setRequestProperty(Unknown Source)...
</code></pre>

<p>After doing a little Googling, I found out that the exception is mislabeled. Jersey shouldn&rsquo;t be throwing an IllegalStateException. It should be a SSLHandshakeException. Ok, so the question is: What&rsquo;s the workaround? We need to get Jersey (version 2) to accept a self-signed SSL certificate. This requires creating a class with a method we can call to help build a client with the needed configurations. I created this class exactly as Aleksandr Panzin demonstrated <a href="https://gist.github.com/JAlexoid/b15dba31e5919586ae51">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once I added the <code>JerseyWithSSL</code> class, I realized, &ldquo;Hey, Aleksandr didn&rsquo;t explain how to actually use it!&rdquo; And so now, I provide to you the complete solution! Back in my resources class, I created a client using the <code>JerseyWithSSL</code> method <code>initClient()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import java.security.KeyManagementException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.client.Client;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig;

@Path("/ticket")
public class Ticket

@POST
public Response createTicket(...) {
    ClientConfig cc = new ClientConfig();
    Client client = null;
    try {
        client = new JerseyWithSSL().initClient(cc);
    } catch (KeyManagementException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) { 
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

// Use client as you need...
</code></pre>

<p>The trick was figuring out what exactly the <code>Configuration</code> parameter was supposed to be in the <code>initClient()</code> method. An instance of <code>ClientConfig</code> did the trick. I&rsquo;m happy to say my application works due to this code! Hopefully, it will help you if you ever come across this error.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m writing this blog post for women who aspire to be software engineers. What is it like on your first day on the job as a software engineer? This is my experience:</p>

<h4>EXCITING!</h4>

<p>I worked hard to get here. I thought graduation day was great, but my first day on the job was truly the reward. Walking into that office this morning was a very proud moment! I love all the firsts of a first day: a new computer, a new workspace, a new project, meeting new people, getting that badge to get in and out of the building (with my face on it!). It was very exciting and made the day fly by!</p>

<h4>CONFUSED!</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that from large corporation to small startup, acronyms are consistently thrown around. On my first day, as we did our daily standup meeting and then a &ldquo;here&rsquo;s an overview of this project,&rdquo; all I could think about was counting up all the acronyms. Every department has an acronym, our project title is an acronym, and let&rsquo;s face it, everything in computer science is an acronym (XML, JSON, REST, API,&hellip;). I accepted that, in time, I&rsquo;d learn who/what all these acronyms stood for.</p>

<h4>SMART!</h4>

<p>Yeah, I did feel pretty smart. I looked through source code, writing down the classes, how they connect, what they (seemingly) do&hellip;and I felt capable! I felt I was trained pretty well at reading code, understanding it, how to look up things I wasn&rsquo;t sure about&hellip;it was great!</p>

<p>My first day on the job as a software engineer was all I hoped it would be. I&rsquo;ll report on my first week in my next blog post!</p>

    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/07/20/i-graduated-now-what</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/PennDiploma.jpg" title="UPenn Diploma" alt="UPenn Diploma"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. I&rsquo;ve earned my Master&rsquo;s in Computer and Information Technology. It&rsquo;s a wonderful and strange feeling. I certainly went out of my comfort zone, learned a new skill set, and loved every minute of it. But of course, I&rsquo;m not done learning yet.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve been job hunting, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn new programming languages while strengthening the ones I know. To be honest, there really isn&rsquo;t one aspect of development that I love over another. I love coding the full stack. I honestly don&rsquo;t care what programming language I&rsquo;m using either (well&hellip;as long as it&rsquo;s not C). I stumbled upon <a href="www.codeeval.com">CodeEval</a>, a website full of programming problems. I decided to do at least one problem each day. At first, I was only doing the problems in Java since that&rsquo;s my strongest language. According to my CodeEval <a href="https://www.codeeval.com/profile/LBecker/">profile</a>, I&rsquo;m one of the top 15% Java developers sitewide (out of 6,000+)! Then I realized this would be a great way to get better at coding in other languages I&rsquo;m interested in. So besides a not-so-little side project in Python/Flask, I decided to start solving CodeEval problems in Python. It&rsquo;s taught me a lot of the ins-and-outs of Python. I really get a kick out of successfully solving some of these intricate coding problems!</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not partial to front-end or back-end development. I truly enjoy doing both. While looking at job descriptions, it seemed to me that many companies might actually benefit from having someone like me - someone who can code Java one day, and JavaScript the next. JavaScript and I have a funny history. Sometimes I love it (you know, when it works) and sometimes I hate it (let&rsquo;s face it - sometimes JS forces you to write ugly code). But with all the frameworks to choose from, JavaScript can be tolerable, even enjoyable. I enrolled in <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. Supposedly, it takes a year to complete, but I&rsquo;m already more than half way through and I just started 2 weeks ago. It was a good brush-up on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. I completed all the JavaScript lessons (through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>) and now I&rsquo;m doing JavaScript &ldquo;bonfires&rdquo; (through Free Code Camp): programming problems to get you familiar with common built-in functions like Array.split(), filter, etc.</p>

<p>As I started completing the JavaScript bonfires, I thought to myself, &ldquo;Hmm, wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to try to solve CodeEval problems in JavaScript?&rdquo;. So I tried&hellip;and I was able to do it! I&rsquo;m the only one in Philadelphia who has solved any CodeEval problem in JavaScript! <strong>I AM THE FIRST!</strong> Currently, I&rsquo;m in 11th place on the Philadelphia All-Time Leaderboard. I plan on getting into the Top 10 this week.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing since I graduated: Improving. Job hunting. I hope the job hunting will end soon, though. As much fun as I&rsquo;m having learning on my own, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to when you&rsquo;re completing a <em>real</em> project with <em>real</em> requirements for a <em>real</em> client. Hopefully my next blog post will be about my first day as a software engineer! Until next time!</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/05/04/graduation-in-t-minus-12-days/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/2015grad.jpg" alt="The Graduate" />
It&rsquo;s been a very long time since I&rsquo;ve updated this blog, so let me fill you in:</p>

<p>CIS 555: I have nearly completed one of the hardest courses in computer science at The University of Pennsylvania. And I&rsquo;ve done really well, even though I totally struggled with some of the assignments (we have to implement what now?). Struggling is good. Struggling means you&rsquo;re learning something. In 4 days, my group and I will demo our search engine that we wrote from the ground up. If we ever get it working in full (fingers crossed!). I was assigned to do the Search Engine and web interface, which is great for me. I like doing a litte bit of everything. I designed the front-end and I do a great job of communicating with databases in AWS to get results, rank them, and display them. I&rsquo;m proud of my code. It&rsquo;s tested, commented, and it works!</p>

<p>Philly Women In Tech Conference: I went to it after I snagged a free ticket. I&rsquo;m really glad I didn&rsquo;t pay for that ticket, because the conference was terrible. There are a lot of women who want to be grouped into the &ldquo;Women In Tech&rdquo; label because, let&rsquo;s face it, that&rsquo;s a pretty sweet label to have. I do believe, however, that women who work for a tech company in a capacity other than engineering (say: an HR rep for a tech company) are NOT &ldquo;Women In Tech.&rdquo; The conference was more about entrepreneurship than technical skills or the climate in the tech industry in Philadelphia. And the women who attended didn&rsquo;t seem like they knew anything about tech at all. One of the sponsors of the conference, TechGirlz, an organization that tries to encourage young girls to go into tech, is stating that tech is not all about knowing how to code. It really bothers me that an organization that should be promoting computer science is now undermining it as a way to attract a wider audience. Tech is definitely about coding and coding is fun!</p>

<p>Graduating in T-12 days: I have my cap and gown. On a daily basis, I get e-mails congratulating me on my achievement and telling me all the last-minute wrap-ups I need to do before Commencement. It seems surreal. I haven&rsquo;t actually started my job search yet. People keep telling me about opportunities and I&rsquo;m just not ready to apply yet. I&rsquo;m still finishing up CIS 555 - that&rsquo;s my main priority. Then I need a little rest because I&rsquo;ve been on edge with due dates pounding me every week for the past 2 years. I&rsquo;ll regain a little sanity and then begin applying to my future employer (whoever that may be).</p>

<p>I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the MCIT program and my professors who have helped me along the way. I am honored to have been chosen for the program and so happy to have successfully completed it. I&rsquo;m excited to see where my degree will take me!</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/03/23/reinventing-the-wheel-or-web-server/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-23T09:10:53-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/03/23/reinventing-the-wheel-or-web-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My current (and final) course before I graduate has given me a new appreciation for Java packages. As developers, we use them all the time. In some cases, the more packages you know about, the more efficient and readable your code may be and the more sanity you get to keep.</p>

<p>My appreciation for packages has grown because the assignments I&rsquo;ve had to do for this course have basically asked me to build a number of things from scratch:</p>

<ul>
<li>A web server</li>
<li>An HTTP client</li>
<li>A thread pool</li>
<li>A servlet container</li>
<li>An XPath parser</li>
<li>An matcher between an XPath and an XML document.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, someone has already written the code to do all of these things in Java. It&rsquo;s either already built into Java or you can download a jar file to use it. But try writing these things from scratch and you&rsquo;ll find that you begin to write some of the nastiest code you&rsquo;ve ever written. Classes become horribly coupled, but that&rsquo;s the only way to make the application work. For writing your own servlet container, the API that describes the HttpRequest and HttpResponse interface methods is lacking. But it will make you appreciate Tomcat and all the work that went into making it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amusing that as a computer science student, I have been given a repetoire of principles to code by - DRY, KISS, YAGNI - and most of my assignments force me to violate them one way or another. Sure, writing certain functionality from scratch to really understand how things work under the covers is a great learning experience. But it&rsquo;s hardly simple when I could just import a package and use the classes/methods within it. Reinventing the wheel (or the web server, or the XPath parser, etc.) is a lot trickier than you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2015/01/28/a-year-and-a-half-later/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/comfortzone.jpg" alt="My favorite poster in Towne Building" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started my last course before I graduate in May. Of course, in typical Lori-fashion, I decided to take one of the hardest courses the computer science department at UPenn has to offer: CIS 555 - Internet and Web Systems. Why did I want to take such a hard course? Why not just breeze my way through some easier class instead? Because this class is a true test of all I&rsquo;ve learned in the past year and a half. It will turn all of the things I&rsquo;ve studied and make me apply them in challenging, new ways.</p>

<p>The first assignment is to build a web server from scratch. I have to write EVERYTHING. I can&rsquo;t even use Java&rsquo;s concurrent library to implement a thread pool. I have to do everything myself. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this blog post. Procrastinating? No, not at all. The first step is always to think it through. Make a plan. Then execute. I&rsquo;m in the thinking phase, slowly making a plan.</p>

<p>Which is why I decided to write this blog post. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how crazy it is that I&rsquo;m actually taking this class and doing this assignment. A year and a half ago, I didn&rsquo;t know how to program. I didn&rsquo;t know what a &ldquo;data structure&rdquo; was. I didn&rsquo;t know what an &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; was. I didn&rsquo;t know what a web server was. The internet was MAGIC. Software was MAGIC. Sometimes, I like to think about all the people on their cell phones, tablets, and computers for leisure or business and how they know NOTHING about the work that went into every detail of that device, the OS, and the software they&rsquo;re running. And I do. I do know (sort of) what it takes to make what most people take for granted as they use their gadgets. It&rsquo;s unbelievably impressive! More impressive: I can do these things!</p>

<p>This is really a testament to how great Penn&rsquo;s program is. The kid gloves were off before I stepped into my first class. I wanted to learn computer science and I was (as) ready (as I could be) for the challenge. I was worried, though. Could my professors really teach a photographer/English teacher how to write code? Yes, and they did. There were times when I felt like I was drowning, but I kept kicking. I went to sleep and found myself coding in my dreams (good code, too! Code I could use when I woke up!).</p>

<p>For anyone who thinks they don&rsquo;t fit the mold (mould for you UKers) for a particulary area of study, who thinks they&rsquo;re too old to learn something completely new &ndash; you can. It takes some getting used to when you&rsquo;re out of your comfort zone. But that&rsquo;s how you grow. That&rsquo;s how I got to where I am now.</p>

<p>What a difference a year and a half can make.</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/12/22/were-not-serious-about-software-security/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-22T11:22:10-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/12/22/were-not-serious-about-software-security</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Lulled Into A False Sense of Security</h3>

<p>It seems to happen every day and the public is appalled for about one second before it&rsquo;s back to business as usual. I&rsquo;m talking about hacking, not in the &ldquo;finding creative solutions&rdquo; sense, but the finding and exploiting of software vulnerabilities. Sony got hacked. Private e-mails and documents were released in retaliation for an &ldquo;unflattering&rdquo; movie about North Korea (supposedly). In past years, the big box stores have been hacked again and again. Customer credit card numbers were stolen. Still, people continue to swipe their credit cards at Target and Home Depot without blinking an eye.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not serious about software security. The public doesn&rsquo;t care enough to change their habits and pressure companies to store their data safely and securely. And what can these companies do when they&rsquo;re at the mercy of the software company that developed the software they use?  Most software companies don&rsquo;t seem to care about exploits, unless it comes to their legal team, in which case, they&rsquo;ve already placed a disclaimer that using this software is at your own risk. So, these breaches seem to be par for the course. No one really takes responsibility. Another day, another hack.</p>

<h3>Universities: Software Security is a Choice, Not a Requirement</h3>

<p>This semester, I took a software engineering course which centered around the internal and external metrics of software quality as defined by ISO-9126. One of the external metrics was security. For software to be considered secure, it has to verify data is only accessible by authorized users and that code cannot be manipulated by outside sources. My professor showed us a few ways we could exploit programs in Java. Suddenly, everyone in the class realized how all the programs we&rsquo;d written throughout our careers as students (and possibly during our internships) were horribly insecure (Thanks, Java. Why SecurityManager is disabled by default, I&rsquo;ll never understand). And this was just in Java. What back doors exist in other programming languages?</p>

<p>Most university computer science programs have a computer and network security course. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s usually an elective rather than a required course. Just do a Google search for &ldquo;required computer science courses&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll see a list of university web sites, all of which list computer security as an elective course.</p>

<p>Digging further, what do students who take these computer security courses actually learn? Examining a wide variety of universities, the descriptions of these courses vary greatly. Some, like the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/catalog/2013-14/courses/engr/b-csci/4133-security-laboratory">University of Colorado Boulder</a> give students hands-on experiences with finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. Right next door, <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs556/">Colorado State University&rsquo;s</a> computer security course states, &ldquo;In this course, we will begin by investigating some of the security measures that can be employed to safeguard information. For the most part we will look into the theory that goes into designing these measures rather than studying security tools and techniques. This is primarily because there are too many of those tools out there and they are changing frequently.&rdquo; Does a course that focuses more on theory than practice do a disservice to future software developers? Will Colorado State University&rsquo;s students create programs be as secure as say, the ones created by UC Boulder students who took Security Laboratory?</p>

<h3>Untraditional Routes: Learn To Code, Not Learn To Code Securely</h3>

<p>More and more people are taking different, untraditional routes into computer science. While it seems that teaching students how to write secure software is optional at the university level, these other paths into computer science seem to offer no instruction about writing secure software. Take, for example, the well-respected Flatiron School in New York. Nowhere in their <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/">curriculum</a> do they discuss security. The focus is on learning new technologies and writing code that works. Their graduates go off to work at well-known companies, just like university students, none-the-wiser about writing secure code.</p>

<p>Many other people are taking advantage of free online courses to teach themselves how to code. They could take this Coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec">course</a> on computer security, but the recommended background is for someone with a solid foundation in computer science, not someone trying to learn computer science on their own. I&rsquo;ll bet most self-learners won&rsquo;t be considering this course. The question is, will those already entrenched in computer science be motivated to take this course?</p>

<h3>Software Security is an Afterthought</h3>

<p>Without making software security a priority in our educational institutions and for hiring qualified software engineers, software will continue to be vulnerable to many preventable attacks. It&rsquo;s impossible to have an inpenetrable program. But there is so much we could do to make software more secure. If only there was some initiative on behalf of universities and other computer science-based schools to produce software developers who are knowledgeable in writing programs with some basic security measures in mind. And there needs to be more initiative on the part of companies to not only hire developers that are qualified to write working, secure code, but to take responsibility when their software leaks out sensitive information. As more and more of our lives become digitized, security should become a top priority, not an afterthought.</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/why-i-type-in-dvorak/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-13T19:42:21-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/why-i-type-in-dvorak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/dvorak.jpg" title="Dvorak keyboard" alt="Dvorak keyboard"></p>

<p>If you do a considerable amount of typing on a daily basis and have experienced stiffness or pain in the joints of your fingers, this post is for you. I used to have these problems, but a rather simple switch made all the difference.</p>

<h3>What is Dvorak?</h3>

<p>Dvorak is a keyboard layout in which the most commonly typed letters are on the home row. The layout was meant to increase typing speed and decrease typing fatigue. Dr. August Dvorak, a psychologist, and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, did extensive research on how people typed using the standard QWERTY keyboard. Dvorak thought QWERTY was inefficient and burdensome for users. In QWERTY, typing the most used letters requires users to move up or down from the home row and puts more emphasis on typing with the left hand. So, Dvorak and Dealey came up with the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard to tackle these inefficiencies.</p>

<h3>How Hard Was It To Learn?</h3>

<p>I typed in QWERTY for most of my life. I&rsquo;m sure many of you will remember being in elementary or middle school and taking a typing class where the teacher would call out letters and you&rsquo;d press the corresponding keys. Or maybe you played some typing game where you had to type &ldquo;garbage words&rdquo; as fast as you could and see if you could beat your best words per minute score.</p>

<p>Dvorak is not any different. You need to learn where the letters are and you need to practice. I found it easiest to buy some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SIMPLIFIED-KEYBOARD-LETTERING-TRANSPARENT-BACKGROUND/dp/B0011FI3O8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416080332&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dvorak+keyboard+stickers">Dvorak keyboard stickers</a> so I could look down at the keys to see where all the letters were until I could touch-type in Dvorak. I found a <a href="http://gigliwood.com/abcd/lessons/">nice website</a> to practice learning where the keys were and gain some speed. And I went cold-turkey and typed in Dvorak for work and home computer activities. In 2 weeks, I was typing 40 wpm and Dvorak seemed rather normal. After a year and a half of typing in Dvorak, I type about 80 wpm and I have exceptional accuracy &ndash; almost 99% according to the typing test I just took &ndash; and that&rsquo;s comparable or better to what I typed using QWERTY.</p>

<h3>Why Bother Learning Dvorak?</h3>

<p>The main benefit of learning Dvorak for me was to reduce finger joint pain. I once worked as a processing associate, a nice title for sitting in a cubicle all day and transcribing loads of documents into 3 different databases. I typed all day long, fingers glued to the keyboard. A year into that job, I had to go to an occupational therapist because I had extreme pain in my fingers to the point that I could not bend them at the joints. The therapist said my joints were swollen due to typing so much and that the best way to relieve the swelling was just not to type! Obviously, that wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>

<p>I tried all sorts of &ldquo;ergonomic&rdquo; things to help alleviate pain caused by constant typing. I wore <a href="http://www.imakproducts.com/product.php?c=Wrist+/+Carpal+Tunnel&amp;s=10">wrist gloves</a> and had gel pads for the keyboard and mouse. I received a special keyboard at work with soft-press keys. But none of those things had any effect.</p>

<p>So, I learned Dvorak. Now, I type for at least 10 hours per day, every day, and I have not experienced the pain and stiffness in my fingers that I had as a processing associate. Dvorak was right: putting the important keys on the home row and dispersing what keys are pressed evenly between the left and right hand reduces finger/wrist strain. I&rsquo;ve never looked back on my decision to switch. It really helped me continue typing comfortably.</p>

<h3>What are Dvorak&rsquo;s Drawbacks?</h3>

<p>Well, for one, you&rsquo;ll selectively forget QWERTY. I can&rsquo;t touch-type in QWERTY anymore. Sit me at a computer with its keyboard set to QWERTY (which is the default keyboard layout, of course) and I&rsquo;m like a 5 year old pressing keys with my index finger when I find the key with the right letter on it. But I did say that forgetting QWERTY is <strong>selective</strong>. I can oddly type on a QWERTY keyboard no problem&ndash;wait for it&ndash;on my cell phone. Yes, that&rsquo;s right - the keyboard that pops up on my phone is in standard QWERTY and I have no issues swiping words or pressing individual letters. I oddly know where the letters reside even though I can&rsquo;t do this when sitting in front of an actual keyboard. I have no idea why this happens.</p>

<p>The second drawback is that there are other keyboard layouts out there that are specifically designed to alleviate repetitive strain injuries. They may be better than Dvorak. I&rsquo;ve never used them. Learning a second layout was enough for me…and it&rsquo;s one that is supported by most operating systems unlike some of these other layouts designed to help RSI.</p>

<p>The third drawback you might not even consider a drawback - other people can&rsquo;t type on your computer. So, if you do a lot of collaboration on your computer, you&rsquo;ll have to switch the keyboard back to QWERTY for those other users to type. But it is a lot of fun to hand someone your computer when the keyboard layout is set to Dvorak and see the havoc unfold as your colleague types in something and cannot understand why the computer spits out gibberish!</p>

<h3>Why I Love Dvorak</h3>

<p>The number one reason I love typing in Dvorak is, of course, that I am comfortable and pain-free. While there are some studies out there that dispute Dvorak&rsquo;s ability to alleviate RSI, it sure has for me. I enjoy knowing that someone can watch me type in my password, but they&rsquo;ll never know what it is just by watching what keys I press. I enjoy the fact that others cannot really use my computer because Dvorak keeps them from doing anything that cannot be accomplished without the keyboard. To sum it up, it&rsquo;s good for my health and my digital security. And it might be good for yours, too!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[From Shakespeare to Java]]></title>
    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/10/08/from-shakespeare-to-java/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-08T21:56:58-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/10/08/from-shakespeare-to-java</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/engineeringbanner.jpg" title="Penn Engineering" alt="Penn Engineering"></p>

<p>A little more than a ago, I was a high school English teacher. I walked around a classroom supervising activities to help my students grasp key concepts of reading, writing, and the &ldquo;collective human experience.&rdquo; And yes, I did teach Shakespeare (&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; to be exact).</p>

<p><strong>So how does a high school English teacher become a software engineer?</strong></p>

<p>Three events happened simultaneously back in April 2013. The first was hitting my 5 year mark as a teacher and not having a permanent position. For 5 years, I had worked in 6 school districts, but the positions were always temporary. School districts were receiving less funding from the state, causing districts to remove teaching positions in favor of larger class sizes. Other districts were laying off teachers in the thousands, causing massive competition for any permanent position out there. I was frustrated. I was a great teacher, I loved my subject, and I loved the profession. But the opportunities were drying up more and more every day and my future was frighteningly uncertain.</p>

<p>The second event had been mulling around for a while, but became a beacon of hope in April. My best friend kept telling me I&rsquo;d make a fantastic software developer. He tried to convince me that computer science <em>is</em> a creative endeavor. He pointed out that I love puzzles (it&rsquo;s true - I do crosswords and logic puzzles on my smartphone all the time) and that writing code is like solving puzzles all day. The more he talked about it, the more interested I became. I considered teaching myself how to code using online resources or attending coding workshops, but then…</p>

<p>My best friend talked to one of his co-workers, who just happenend to have been an English major who went through the MCIT program at the University of Pennsylvania and received a Masters in computer science. It turned out the MCIT program was one of the few in the country that would take students from other disciplines and teach them all the fundamentals of computer science (and then some). After I heard about MCIT, I was pretty convinced that this was an opportunity of a lifetime. I didn&rsquo;t really know if I was going to like programming. But sometimes other people see more in us than we can see in ourselves. So, I applied to the MCIT program…and got accepted!</p>

<p>Today, I know my best friend was right…perhaps too right. Programming is a creative process. It is a long string of puzzles (&ldquo;How do I make the computer do <em>this</em>?&rdquo;). It is challenging, rewarding, frustrating, and awesome all at the same time.</p>

<p>My experience transitioning from English teacher to software engineer (or as I like to say, from Shakespeare to Java) is why I am such an advocate for teaching others about the field of computer science. I think that despite our leaps forward in technology and that most of us use computers and smartphones daily, we are extremely disconnected from what makes all of our electronics&#8217; functionality possible. The younger generation has to actively seek out what computer science is, because it is rarely taught in the public school system. I hope that in the future, more people are at least somewhat knowledgable about programming, even if it is at a very basic level.</p>

<p>So what does the future hold for an English teacher turned software engineer? I don&rsquo;t know, but I can&rsquo;t wait to find out.</p>

    <link href="http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/the-trouble-with-math-in-computer-science-education/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-23T21:04:27-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/the-trouble-with-math-in-computer-science-education</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/math.jpeg" title="math cartoon" alt="math cartoon"></p>

<p>Mathematics made computer science possible. From the Turing-Church papers to Von Neumann architecture, many of the things we take for granted are the direct result of some mathematician&rsquo;s discoveries.</p>

<p>University computer science programs require students to take math courses. To some extent, this is a reasonable requirement. Learning about DFAs and NFAs are the underpinning of creating compilers. Learning about relations is important in understanding database design. Clearly, mathematics has had a profound influence over computer science.</p>

<p>The irony is that only a small fraction of computer science graduates utilize the broad span of discrete mathematics and computational theory out in the workforce. So why are universities so set on requiring these courses to computer science students? Is it to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/17/education.stem.graduation/">discourage</a> those &ldquo;on the fence&rdquo; about their area of study? Is it just that tradition is difficult to break? Or are these courses <em>truly</em> important (and if so, for who?)?</p>

<h3>The Mathematics Experience</h3>

<p>There are many reasons students struggle in the mathematics courses universities require for a degree in computer science. For one, American students generally come from schools that teach math in a rather ineffective way, as shown through numerous studies (the US Department of Education disputes this…imagine that). When students arrive in their Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science and Theory of Computation courses, they&rsquo;re ill prepared to handle the concepts being covered. This is especially true if they were not able to take higher level mathematics courses in high school.</p>

<p>In addition, as with most college courses, the material is taught in a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; manner. The expectation is that students be responsible for their own learning, utilize recitations and office hours to ask questions, and find supplemental material to help them learn as needed. Unfortunately, a large portion of the mathematical concepts in computer science are so abstract that no matter what book, website, or video a student finds, the material is presented in <em>exactly</em> the same way as it was taught in class. If that method isn&rsquo;t helpful, there are no other recourses.</p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the problem of motivation. Students know they will not be writing proofs, drawing DFAs, or calculating the closure of a set of functional dependencies out in the workforce. For some students, these things may be exciting and worthwhile, but for others, learning these concepts is a waste of time. They take the course because it is a requirement, not because they are truly interested in the material or think it will be beneficial to their future career. And what happens when the course is over? ALL IS FORGOTTEN.</p>

<h3>The Push For Mathematical Theory in Computer Science</h3>

<p>Required mathematics courses may be lacking in practicality, but many computer science courses can also become bogged down in mathematical theory. Take, for instance, the topic of databases. Relational databases surely have their roots in relational algebra and calculus. To create a well-designed database, one must understand functional dependencies, closure, and algorithms for such things as BCNF. Yet, these concepts are mathematically intensive and for the average computer science student, they are completely unnecessary for learning how to work with the databases they will encounter after they graduate. The time invested in teaching mathematical theory takes away time to teach other, more practical skills and concepts in computer science.</p>

<h3>A Modest Proposal</h3>

<p>I propose that there should be two tracks of computer science. During a student&rsquo;s freshman year, they take courses that give a general overview of different areas of study within the field of computer science. This way, they are informed about the different careers available to them, from DBA to data scientist to front-end developer.</p>

<p>In the sophomore year, they begin to branch into one of two tracks. The first is more mathematically intensive and for good reason - their career paths require it. If a student wants to do machine learning, they need to have a good grasp of statistics, linear algebra, and calculus to write the code. It&rsquo;s really just that simple. There are certain areas of computer science that require a high level of mathematical prowess. This track is for students who wish to pursue those areas.</p>

<p>The other track is less concerned about mathematics. It still contains math coursework and in some cases, integrates mathematics into its computer science courses. The difference is that it teaches very practical math that is actually used to do specific tasks in computer science. Theoretical mathematics is left to the first track, since those students will benefit more from learning it. The students in this track may learn some of the same concepts as their peers in the first track, but in a more concrete way. For example, a student in this track may learn about relational databases and how lossless join works, but it will be taught using plain language, not in mathematical notation.</p>

<p>What about graduate school, you may be wondering. I still propose that there should be two options for certain courses, like Databases and Machine Learning. The University of Pennsylvania offered two machine learning courses at the graduate level this semester: one which was math intensive, one that was less so. Machine learning is so in demand by industry right now that it just makes sense to provide multiple ways of teaching the material to maximize the amount of people who understand and practice it. Clearly stripping away some of the mathematics in computer science courses can be done with great success and provide access to concepts that used to be reserved for the mathematically-inclined.</p>

<p>You may think I&rsquo;m advocating for dumbing down computer science by removing mathematics. I&rsquo;m not. What I am advocating for is making computer science coursework more tailored to the needs of both students and industry. It&rsquo;s time to reevaluate what is being taught in computer science courses and make room to teach what is truly important today and in the years to come.</p>

<h6>wtf - code quality measurement by <a href="https://flic.kr/p/4qquBv">smitty42</a></h6>

<h3>Some Background</h3>

<p>For two semesters, my programming professor (then head of the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s MCIT program) taught me a number of Agile techniques &ndash; unit testing, coding standards, refactoring, TDD, and pair programming. Since I hadn&rsquo;t really done any programming before entering MCIT, I didn&rsquo;t have any bad habits that needed to be unlearned. I do know that I did not follow TDD as well as I should (write tests before writing the method? Impossible!), but I slowly adapted the right way to do TDD.</p>

<p>During my summer internship, I was surprized to learn that no one seemed to write any tests for their code. To be fair, I didn&rsquo;t either, because I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how to test HTML and JavaScript without actually starting up the website and verifying its look and behavior. My boss exclaimed, &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t actually do test driven development in industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently taking a software engineering course, which focuses on how to measure if a piece of code is &ldquo;good.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an entire class about software development best practices. Many articles I&rsquo;ve had to read for the course all have an interesting theme through them. &ldquo;But [author&rsquo;s name here], what if my company doesn&rsquo;t practice Agile development?&rdquo; The answer: Do it anyway.</p>

<h3>Some Statistics</h3>

<p>I wanted to know if my former boss was right. Does industry NOT follow TDD? So, I found a 2013 survey called <a href="http://stateofagile.com/8th-annual-state-of-agile-form/">State of Agile</a> from VersionOne. Now given, VersionOne makes a product to help companies adapt Agile techniques, so I&rsquo;d say the results are skewed when the report says 88% of respondants say their company practices Agile development. But what&rsquo;s more interesting is what techniques those companies that do Agile development actually use:</p>

<ul>
<li>85% have a Daily Standup meeting.</li>
<li>72% utilize unit testing.</li>
<li>47% refactor their code.</li>
<li>38% practice Test Driven Development.</li>
<li>30% do pair programming.</li>
</ul>


<p>So it seems my former boss was right! TDD is not popular, despite it&rsquo;s obvious benefits (&ldquo;Using TDD, you are never far from working code…&rdquo;).</p>

<h3>Some Inferences</h3>

<p>The statistics are what each company openly practices in terms of Agile techniques. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that their developers aren&rsquo;t doing things like refactoring and TDD on their own! After all, these developers are supposed to be professionals. They probably do incorporate best practices to do their work (at least, we can hope so!).</p>

<p>We can also infer that some Agile practices are more beneficial than others. While I have done pair programming in the past, it&rsquo;s not a big deal if a company doesn&rsquo;t embrace that technique. It&rsquo;s great to get a new employee up to speed on a piece of code and add new functionality to it, but it&rsquo;s not a necessity.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I am a firm believer of good practices. Anyone who has me on their team will know that the code I produce has been tested, refactored, and written with a great deal of attention, care, and dedication.</p>

<h3>The Takeaway</h3>

<p>All developers should be aware of key Agile techniques and incorporate them into how they code. Not testing or refactoring your code is a very, VERY bad idea. Those 60+ hour weeks might very well be the result of poor coding practices, which, as <em>Business Insider</em> explains, may be driving you and your co-workers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/syndromes-drive-coders-crazy-2014-3">crazy</a>.</p>

<h6>Essays - a cartoon by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markuz/5476354835/in/photolist-9kVKuX-DPuZr-cyzFqh-dgBX5h-dcn2NC-bk3mFf-2CcMj-73wwvy-8HqhkF-nPej2Z-4auAXX-4auvCv-4aux7x-4auEfe-4auxDT-4auM64-4auQa8-4auNpa-nuV3GR-nMpVwR-nuX4Pf-nuVMGg-nuX4SS-nuVMg6-nPcfYZ-nuY9BP-nPeCHB-nuV58X-nMpVpr-nMpURT-nMn1JE-nuV42D-nuXEX3-nKp6ch-nuVMT8-nMePeN-nuVMap-nKngMu-nPeCEa-nuXyMe-nKnid5-nPeCYX-nuV3Mv-nMn2eC-nuXEoY-nuY9yH-nKpFhS-nMpnLL-nKnhPj-nuXyh6">Marco Antonio Islas Cruz</a></h6>

<p>There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_programming_languages">thousands</a> of programming languages. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses, its own special qualities, and some have very specific purposes.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://www.itworld.com/career/436261/college-students-learning-cobol-make-more-money">this</a> article about a Texas university&rsquo;s graduates getting a $10,000 bump in salary for taking an elective course on COBOL, I started thinking about what programming languages <em>really</em> matter in industry and beyond.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-10-programming-languages">IEEE</a>, Java, C, and C++ are the top 3 programming languages because they are widely used in web, mobile, desktop and embedded development. Python, which has a steadily growing fanbase, is only in 5th place, probably due to the fact that it&rsquo;s not used for mobile or embedded development. This is interesting, considering <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext">Python</a> is currently the most popular language being taught in introductory computer science courses. Does this mean more companies will adapt Python as their primary development language as the graduates look for jobs related to their &ldquo;language of choice&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I put &ldquo;language of choice&rdquo; in quotes for a reason (I&rsquo;m not in this group of <a href="http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/">people</a>). My hunch is that the level of proficiency of a programming language determines the developer&rsquo;s preference for that language. If they don&rsquo;t know it well, it&rsquo;s not going to be their favorite, even if it might be better for the project at hand. (As it turns out, this hunch is seemingly <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2gos1e/is_your_preferred_programming_language_the_same/">incorrect</a>. Thank you, Reddit responders.)</p>

<p>That leads me to believe that out of the thousands of programming languages currently out there, the ones most utilized in industry may not be the optimal ones. They&rsquo;re just the standard. Java might be the dominant language, but some other language out there might be more efficient and easier to use to do the same tasks! Those other languages are just not well-known by a significant number of people. And of course, companies are notoriously resistant to <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/02/27/web-2-0-languages-david-hasselhoff-common/">change</a>.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, developers will continue to argue about the <em>superior</em> programming language(Python! No, Java! No, Go! No, C#!). They will have conferences championing the accomplishments of their language and what&rsquo;s been created with them. But remember, there are a lot of programming languages out there just waiting to be discovered, learned, and used to build really amazing things! They may just become one of the standard programming languages of the future&hellip;</p>

<h6>The Evolution of Computer Programming Languages by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dullhunk/4833512699/">dullhunk</a></h6>

<p>Learning to code has become a heated topic these days. I read <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/technology-topics/11064505/Creating-a-British-Mark-Zuckerberg-is-all-about-Education-Education-Education.html">this</a> critical article about the UK&rsquo;s decision to teach children to code as part of the curriculum. Then there was <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/09/01/labor_day_2014_tech_skills_are_important_in_the_workplace_but_so_are_other.html">this</a> article about how tech skills are overvalued in today&rsquo;s marketplace. And not to be outdone, there was <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/927675-computer-science-majors-your-degree-may-not-be-as-valuable-as-you-think/">this</a> about how even if a person does get a degree in computer science, they might not have the skills companies want.</p>

<p>So, is learning to code important? If so, should it be a manditory class in elementary/secondary education? If someone wants to learn to code, should they teach themselves for free using the many sites online? What about attending a coding bootcamp? Does majoring in computer science at a college/university really give someone an edge when looking for a software engineering position?</p>

<h3>Is Coding Important?</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s first define &ldquo;important.&rdquo; My definition of important is: useful, bordering on necessary to function in some capacity. In the developed world, I&rsquo;m pretty sure most people would say coding is important. Think of all the things that depend on code for their functionality. Without code, there would be no cell phones and all those apps we love so much. There would be no jobs that use a computer. In our cars, the fancy touchscreens that tell us the traffic on our way to and from work&mdash;gone. The microwave, oven, dishwasher, and wifi connected television would be pretty much useless. The list goes on and on. People who knew how to code made these things possible. It&rsquo;s important that many people know how to code since so much of the convenience of our daily lives depends on it.</p>

<h3>Teaching Children To Code</h3>

<p>The controversy about teaching programming in schools is really a controversy about a broader issue. Is what we teach children in school <em>relevant</em> in today&rsquo;s modern world? Since coding is important in our technology-driven society, it seems <em>relevent</em> to teach it to children. But how many children, and when? Not every child is going to become a software engineer, so some would argue a computer science course should not be a mandatory part of the curriculum. Yet certain other courses are mandatory, like physical education and foreign languages, but children aren&rsquo;t expected to become professional athletes or translators. Those types of courses teach children about healthy lifestyles and other cultures accordingly. Students must take them so they are &ldquo;well-rounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue computer science fits into that &ldquo;well-rounded&rdquo; objective. I was never exposed to computer science in school, so it was never on my radar to learn it. However, I was exposed to art, music, keyboard typing, woodworking, sewing, home economics, Spanish, German, and French in my middle school years (6 - 8). Why not add computer science to the list of &ldquo;exposure courses.&rdquo; Students should be exposed to writing code so they know what it&rsquo;s like and what it can do. If students enjoy learning to program, they can take it as an elective in high school or even pursue it in college. Most schools around the world teach history, so students understand how the world they live in came to be. Computer science will also teach them how the world they live in came to be.</p>

<h3>Learning to Code Through Online Tutorials</h3>

<p>The number of websites that teach visitors to code is <em>staggering</em>. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a>, and <a href="http://learn.code.org/">Code.org</a> to name a few. There are also free online courses through sites like <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> and MIT&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a> that people can take to learn to code.</p>

<p>Before I started the MCIT program, I thought I&rsquo;d give myself a heads-up before classes began and take the Python course on Codecademy. I went through each cutesy little exercise, but truth be told, I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing. Nothing really sunk in. I followed the directions, made guesses on the open-ended exercises, but I didn&rsquo;t see the big picture about what I could really do with if statements and while loops. Making a tip calculator was nice, but too simplistic a view of what coding can <em>really</em> do. That&rsquo;s my opinion. Maybe there are others for whom Codecademy opened doors to all the possibilities! It wasn&rsquo;t for me (when I was a beginner). Note: If you already know how to code and want to learn a new programming language or framework, these websites are invaluable!</p>

<p>I believe in a more structured approach to teaching computer science. For the budget-conscious or for those who want to learn to code to move up in their career, taking courses through Udacity or EdX might be the way to go. It requires the user to be motivated, to put in the time to learn (much more time than it will take going through a Codecademy course), and to be ready for some difficult challenges. These courses are more thorough and will make students better prepared should they want to dive deeper into computer science.</p>

<h3>Learning to Code By Going to a Bootcamp</h3>

<p>Coding bootcamps have started cropping up everywhere in the past few years. Click <a href="http://bootcamper.io/t/type/in-class">here</a> to see an exhaustive list of them! Many of these bootcamps are specialized schools, focusing on one programming language or skill. They&rsquo;re quicker than a college education and cheaper than one, too, but students only learn &ldquo;skills employers want.&rdquo; Some of these schools are partnered with companies that will hire graduates of the program - that&rsquo;s great! But are the students coming out of these schools really prepared to work in the tech industry? Do they know about best practices like what data structure to use in certain situations? Do they practice any test driven development? Will they be relevant in later years when iOS has been replaced by a better mobile OS? What if Ruby becomes obsolete? Will the students of these bootcamps be able to adapt?</p>

<p>These bootcamps seem better for meeting short-term goals and for people who need structure to motivate them. So they may be a step up from online courses at Udacity and EdX, but their long-term success remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>Learning To Code By Studying Computer Science</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how college computer science courses have come under fire for not providing graduates the skills employers want. Employers want people with a broad assortment of technical know-how. It&rsquo;s not just programming languages, but frameworks, databases, specific operating systems, version control systems, testing applications…the list goes on and on! Do colleges teach these skills or are they really more &ldquo;theory driven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can only speak about my experience studying computer science at the graduate level. The courses I&rsquo;ve taken taught me four programming languages, a tad about version control using Git, and test driven development using JUnit for Java. I&rsquo;ve also had courses that taught a lot of theory. I balked at having to take a Discrete Mathematics course. I&rsquo;ll never be writing induction proofs ever again! Yet, the topic of relations came up in my databases course this week and I knew what that really meant because I learned all about it in Discrete Mathematics. Does it really matter that I understand how a relational database works? Maybe not, but it might come in handy somewhere down the line. I didn&rsquo;t think knowing relations was important, but databases today wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without it!</p>

<p>Theory is dismissed as fluff by critics, but they do not seem to understand that theory is what makes <em>reality</em>. People who learn theory can then apply it to real-world situations. Computational theory influenced Alan Turing who, in turn, theorized the Turing machine (which you can now make out of <a href="http://youtu.be/cYw2ewoO6c4">Legos</a>…), and was the basis of all computing today. Brilliant people know both theory and current, practical skills. They can adapt because they see The Big Picture.</p>

<p>Employers may want people with skills, but they also want people with experience. Knowing this fact will help you choose a good college with a good program. Colleges cannot teach students everything for the workplace, because employers vary widely in what they do! That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to choose a university that balances theory with practical applications and provides internship opportunities to gain experience in the field.</p>

<p>For these reasons, employers may value someone with a college degree in computer science more highly than someone with the same skillset without a degree. Someone who really understands the ins-and-outs of computer science might be able to adapt to changes in technology more easily than someone who has been self-taught. But employers keep their options open. There are many programmers out there without a college education who are doing great work. It&rsquo;s clearly not the end of the world to know how to code and not have a college degree in computer science. However, it may be more difficult to find a programming position considering many large companies require their developers to have a computer science degree.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Learning to code is important, if only to understand how modern technology works. If you&rsquo;re interested in coding, there are tons of online resources, workshops, bootcamps, and colleges ready to help you on your way. Choose what&rsquo;s best for your style of learning and level of motivation. There is no one right way to learn how to code. There&rsquo;s only <em>your</em> way.</p>

<h6>&ldquo;I-quit illustration&rdquo; by Fritz at <a href="http://www.hikingartist.com">hikingartist.com</a></h6>

<p>The Fall semester started this week and a common thread appeared. In my first class, Databases and Information Systems, the professor went over a slide showing the breakdown of how each student would be graded. &ldquo;30% of your grade will be dependent upon a group project,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you do not like working in a group, this class probably isn&rsquo;t for you.&rdquo; This made me wonder if there was another databases course that didn&rsquo;t require a group project. The answer, of course, is NO. The professors of my other two classes declared the same thing - almost a third of my grade will be tied to the success (or failure) of a group project.</p>

<h3>The Push For Working in Groups</h3>

<p>Currently, there is a giant push to teach people how to collaborate with others. In some cases, people are forced to work together because there are many benefits. By working in a group, a teammate can learn a great deal from their peers. They can accomplish bigger tasks in a group. And they will be more tolerant of diversity because they will all be working towards a common goal! Some companies have traded cubicles and offices for the open floor plan. No longer can someone hide behind cheap temporary walls - they must see and talk to the people around them!</p>

<p>The education industry also recognized the importance and benefits of learning to work with others. From an early age, students are placed into groups to complete some task <em>together</em>. Sometimes, it works very well. If a child does not understand a concept, their peer of the same age will use a different vocabulary set than the adult teacher to explain it to them. However, some children will not fair well in groups as social pressures make interacting with others awkward. Nonetheless, educators see this as good practice for the real world when students may need to work with others they do not know or like.</p>

<p>As a former high school English teacher, I pushed students into collaborating with each other for all sorts of writing projects, book reports, and end-of-unit assessments. Some groups did exceptionally well! Others were total disasters. I had done everything by the book (actually, by the books…there are tons of books out there on how to successfully design group projects and get students motivated and ready to work together), but no matter what I did, there would always be at least one group in peril.</p>

<h3>The Collaboration Fallacy</h3>

<p>Groups inevitably fall into a few categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Rockstars - Everyone in the group is equally motivated to complete the assignment and do it well. They innately know how to communicate with each other (usually because they are all friends already). Everyone knows how to do their part, and what they produce is top-notch!</li>
<li>The Average Joes - Most people in the group are motivated to complete the assignment and want to do well. Their expectations are lower than the Rockstars. Some members may not fully know what to do or how to do it, so they contribute whatever they can that fits the bill. It&rsquo;s usually pretty good, but not <em>great</em>.</li>
<li>The Unbalanced Act - This group has a mix of people at horribly different skill sets and/or levels of motivation. There will inevitably be one person who wants to get the task done and ends up shouldering much of the work. This person may or may not be qualified to do that work. Others in the group may either not know what to do or how to complete their piece of the project. Their work may be abhorrent, forcing others in the group to re-do it. There may yet be other members who contribute nothing, either due to lack of motivation or simply being unqualified. Their more knowledgeable teammates don&rsquo;t have the time or patience to teach them, so they just do that person&rsquo;s work for them because <em>it&rsquo;s just easier</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve fallen into the Unbalanced Act group too many times. I&rsquo;ve been the zealous leader who does everything, the worker who slapped things together (which wasn&rsquo;t good enough by another teammate&rsquo;s standards), and I&rsquo;ve been the one who contributed nothing because a zealous teammate didn&rsquo;t want to teach me. They wanted it done &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;right away&rdquo; and just completed my part, in some cases, doing it without telling me while I struggled to try to do it myself.</p>

<p>All of the benefits of collaboration have rarely occurred for me in school/college projects. I didn&rsquo;t learn from my peers. Either I knew the most out of anyone in the group or my peers knew more, but didn&rsquo;t have time to teach me what I needed to learn. &ldquo;We&rdquo; accomplished big tasks, but it was usually the work of one person, maybe two, in a group of four. I suppose it could be said that one person can accomplish a big task after all! And being more tolerant of others? Ha! If anything, working in a group teaches intolerance and resentment, unless the group falls into the Rockstar category with almost no diversity at all.</p>

<h3>Group Project Dynamics Are Different in Industry</h3>

<p>Group projects should be optional in educational settings. I consider grades to be the equivalent of a worker&rsquo;s salary. Unlike the workplace, where one&rsquo;s salary is generally <strong>not</strong> tied to the success of a project, a student&rsquo;s grade (a representation of how much and how well that <em>individual</em> learned something) <strong>is</strong> tied to the success of the project.</p>

<p>Educators rarely want to deal with the problems that arise in groups. Part of learning to work with others is how to deal with these problems. Most educators see group strife as a &ldquo;clash of personalities&rdquo; rather than a clash of skill-sets and make groups work it out on their own. Sure, there are slackers. But many times, the people who can&rsquo;t do their part simply don&rsquo;t know how to do it and deadlines never allow that person to catch up and learn. Yet, once the educator knows the name of the &ldquo;poor group member,&rdquo; their grade will inevitably be negatively affected, even if their poor performance was due to lack of knowledge, the very thing the educator could have alleviated!</p>

<p>In the workplace, that same person would not see their pay reduced because they weren&rsquo;t able to contribute to a project. Rarely would it lead to being fired. Most employers prefer remediataion - &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know how to do that? Let me help you…&rdquo; It is in the best interest of an employer to help their employees because they have already invested in them for the long-term. Educators, however, see students for a year or a semester, making it more difficult to provide the same support as an employer would to their employee.</p>

<h3>Individual Projects Should Be An Option</h3>

<p>If someone wants to work in a group, by all means, go ahead! But for those who wish to be graded on their own merit, who don&rsquo;t want to fall into The Unbalanced Act groups, why not have a separate but equally challenging individual project? It doesn&rsquo;t make them any less able to collaborate with others later when they&rsquo;re in the workplace. Group projects are simply not a fair assessment of an individual&rsquo;s abilities. They do not have all the benefits of those collaborative projects completed out in industry. Providing an alternative project that can be done independently allows students who know they learn best on their own to actually <em>learn</em> something, instead of possibly becoming a problem group member.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-20T10:51:46-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://LCBecker.github.io/blog/2014/08/20/starting-out-at-a-start-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Right now, start-ups in the United States are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/martinzwilling/2013/12/25/a-new-era-for-entrepreneurs-and-startups-has-begun/">booming</a>. Tech start-ups are doing immensely well. Their products and services are unprecedented and larger companies, like Google and Amazon, are buying up start-ups in droves to gain access to both their talent and intellectual property.</p>

<p>When I was searching for an internship, I had a good selection of places to work. Some were start-ups, some were small, established businesses, and others were massive global corporations. At the first MCIT social event, second year students talked about their summer internships. One student&rsquo;s experience really piqued my interest. He did his internship with a start-up and told us about how he was able to learn whatever he thought might help him do his job. If he needed a week to learn a new technology, it was granted. He talked about how he was able to be a jack-of-all-trades because working at a start-up meant all-hands-on-deck. (Ahhh, buzzwords!)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d already worked at a large corporation and I knew that even in the tech department, you might end up in a lonely cubicle with deadlines, Deadlines, DEADLINES!!!! Not only that, many corporations expect you to already know how to do your responsibilities and can be inflexible when it comes to learning on the job, considering those deadlines that must be met. NOW! On the flip side, some corporations give interns menial assignments that will never be put into production.</p>

<p>So, I was excited when one local start-up offered me an internship. My experience was very much like the second-year student who inspired me to embrace start-up life in the first place. I worked in the start-up&rsquo;s brand new office, located in a new and thriving innovation center that also housed other start-ups and incubators. The office was modern and well-furnished. Offices lined one whole wall along with a conference room. There was a kitchen with more counterspace and cabinets than some apartments. Like many tech companies today, the open floorplan is revered. That&rsquo;s where I worked: 6 wooden desks pushed together into one big table, one of many desk-groups in the open floorplan.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say this about open floorplans: They&rsquo;re meant to foster collaboration, and they do. But they also make it difficult to concentrate as people go in and out of the office, move around the space, or as some people collaborate while others are working independently. There were two points during my internship where I needed to get some critical functionality working and I asked to work from home so I could concentrate without constant distractions. Sure enough, working from home made me enormously productive. It made me wonder if the open floorplan&rsquo;s collaborative benefit is worth the loss in productivity associated with the lack of a quiet, private space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written <a href="http://lcbecker.github.io/blog/2014/08/14/learning-on-the-job/">before</a> about what I learned on my internship and how I did it. There&rsquo;s no way I would have mastered all of these new technologies in any environment other than at a start-up. Each time I was given a new project, I had no idea how to go about doing any of it! It was daunting, but I was given time to learn. And it made my successes that much sweeter. I went from, &ldquo;Seriously? I don&rsquo;t know how to do that!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Woohoo, it works! Check it out!&rdquo; My boss let me struggle, but he always had confidence that I&rsquo;d come through. And I did!</p>

<p>The company I interned for was a little more organized than start-ups that are <em>just</em> starting. I was always a developer, but I was sort of a jack-of-all-trades developer. My main focus was front-end development, but that encompasses many realms. Not only did I make a website with dynamic content, I did WordPress development in PHP and created a Play Framework template and controller in Scala. I learned how APIs work, all about HTTP requests, about how to use JSON to do some pretty amazing things. If you had told me back in May that I&rsquo;d be doing these projects, I&rsquo;d have told you that you were crazy. But here I am, at the end of my internship and I&rsquo;m so much more capable of web development that I ever thought possible!</p>

<p>Working at a start-up helped me grow as a software developer. I didn&rsquo;t just learn some great technologies. I learned <em>how to learn</em>. I gained a ton of confidence in my ability to deliver quality results, meeting and, in some cases, exceeding expectations. I will always be grateful to the start-up that believed in me. Thank you!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://LCBecker.github.io/images/The_Big_Bang_Theory_Cast.jpg" width="350" height="350" title="The Big Bang Theory" alt="Copyright 2013 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. All Rights Reserved."></p>

<h3>1. To Qualify, You Must Be A Geek</h3>

<p>Geek. Nerd. Same thing. The terms conjure up images of socially inept geniuses, usually with little to no fashion sense and thick glasses. They don&rsquo;t take showers and they really love Doritos and Mountain Dew.</p>

<p>At some point in time, someone tried to make being a geek/nerd cool. The characters on the Big Bang Theory epitomized &ldquo;geek chic&rdquo;. Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard were to be revered as successful intellectuals &ldquo;with quirks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Their female counterparts have highs and lows. Bernadette is a microbiologist, who makes more money than Howard. Even if she does make more money, her accomplishments are nothing compared to Howard&rsquo;s. After all, HE went into SPACE! Bernadette is awkward with her little squeaky voice…and she marries Howard of all people! Amy is a neurobiologist and she&rsquo;s involved in quirky projects, like the effects of nicotine on monkeys (why?). She&rsquo;s downright unlikable, obsessed with her reproductive system&rsquo;s failings…and she&rsquo;s dating Sheldon of all people! The only successful female scientist on the show is Leonard&rsquo;s mother, a psychologist (you know, the soft sciences) and she&rsquo;s portrayed as a heartless, cold bitch.</p>

<p>Who isn&rsquo;t a geek? Penny. Penny is good-looking. She has social graces. But she&rsquo;s stupid. She&rsquo;s incapable of <a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/The_Gorilla_Experiment">learning Physics</a> or passing a <a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/The_Extract_Obliteration">history class</a> on her own merit. The Big Bang Theory practically oozes the message that pretty girls don&rsquo;t belong in the sphere of science. They can appreciate their boyfriend&rsquo;s accomplishments in STEM, but STEM is not for them. No, Penny can be an actress (although unsuccessful) and even an <a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/The_Work_Song_Nanocluster">entrepreneur</a> (although she needs a man&rsquo;s help to do that), but she&rsquo;ll never be a scientist.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the message being sent to girls by the media. It&rsquo;s not just the Big Bang Theory. It&rsquo;s every science-y show, from Dr. Who (The Doctor understands what&rsquo;s happening, but his female companion will inevitably be the victim) to Bones (sure, Bones is good at forensics, but again, totally socially inept).</p>

<p>The notion that you must be a geek/nerd to enter STEM needs to be crushed. It makes for good television, but it&rsquo;s terrible for recruiting strong, smart, normal women into these fields.</p>

<h3>2. Pink is a Girl&rsquo;s Favorite Color</h3>

<p>If it&rsquo;s pink, girls will like it, some say. A few months ago, <a href="http://www.goldieblox.com/">Goldie Blox</a> burst on the scene to encourage girls that they could do anything! But they&rsquo;re mostly pink. The rest are &ldquo;pastels.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s wrong with regular building blocks colors&ndash;red, blue, yellow, white, and black? Do they discourage girls?</p>

<p>Yes, there are some women who really like the color pink. They embrace feminine things, including feminine colors. But the reality is that using pink actually singles women out, seperates them from the main stream, and gives the feeling that those products are inferior (dare I say &ldquo;dumbed down&rdquo;?). I think it&rsquo;s totally ridiculous that manufacturers think pink is more approachable for girls. A silver computer or a black computer case isn&rsquo;t masculine. Its color does not deter women from using it.</p>

<p>Pinkifying technology to attract girls to STEM is actually a huge turn-off. Let&rsquo;s stop doing it.</p>

<h3>3. Girls Like Doing Girly Things</h3>

<p>I volunteered at The University of Pennsylvania as a helper for an event to encourage middle and high school girls to pursue careers in STEM. It was sponsored by the Society of Women Engineers. As I helped the girls make a windmill to be placed into a wind tunnel (the windmill with the most balance and that withstood the most airflow won), I asked the girls what other things they&rsquo;d done at the event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made lip gloss.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what the girls told me. &ldquo;Was it fun?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; they replied. Making lip gloss was the activity to interest girls in chemistry. I was pretty certain boys didn&rsquo;t pursue chemistry because they once had a teacher who taught them to make homemade lip gloss.</p>

<p>In fact, this is a <a href="http://aspire.swe.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=113">standard lab</a> to inspire girls into the field of chemistry. And that&rsquo;s the problem. The whole mindset that in order to get women into STEM, we need to make STEM &ldquo;girly&rdquo; is just plain wrong. Once again, those that are trying to get women into the sciences are isolating women from the real thing. Instead of getting men and women to work on the same challenging work, women are separated and patronized, even from those of the same gender! Girls don&rsquo;t need pink things and they don&rsquo;t need girly experiments. Girls need to be treated as equals, side by side with men, in the classroom and out in the field.</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>Yes, young women need more positive experiences in STEM. But the images of women in the field are deterrents. Embracing geekiness is great, but it undermines those who are mainstream - male or female. And catering directly to women by embracing the feminine is actually rather patronizing at best. If we are serious about recruiting women into STEM, we need to show them all that STEM has to offer, all that is exciting and intriguing. A few pink gizmos and lip gloss labs isn&rsquo;t going to cut it.</p>
